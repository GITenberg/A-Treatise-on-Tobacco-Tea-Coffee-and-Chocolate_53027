<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">As</span> <cite>Nicolaus Monardus</cite>, in <cite>Simpl.
Med. Histor.</cite> has given so full and
accurate an History and Description
of <em>Tobacco</em>, that others have
only borrowed their Accounts of it from his
Works, we shall, in the Words of that Author,
in <cite>Cap. 14</cite>, inform the Reader what
<em>Tobacco</em> is, where it is produced, and to what
Uses it is applied.</p>

<p>"The Plant <em>Tobacco</em>, says he, was formerly
used by the <em>Indians</em>, and especially
by the Inhabitants of <em>New Spain</em>, for the
Cure of Wounds. A few Years ago it
was imported into <em>Spain</em>, rather for the
Decoration of Gardens, than on Account
of its medicinal Virtues: But it is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
more celebrated for the latter, than used
for the former.</p>

<p>"This Plant is among the <em>Indians</em> called
<em>Picelt</em>; for the <em>Spaniards</em> first called it
<em>Tobacco</em> from a certain Island of that Name,
where great Quantities of it were produced.</p>

<p>"It rises to a great Height, and is sometimes
as tall as the <em>Lemon-Tree</em>. Its Trunk
is strait, and sends out many large Branches,
which bear Leaves almost resembling
those of the <em>Lemon-Tree</em>, but larger, like
those of the <em>Burdock</em>, of a faint green Colour,
and a little rough and shaggy, as the
Whole of the Plant is. The Tops of the
Branches bear Flowers of the Shape of a
small Bell, which are white at the Extremities,
but of a purple Colour in the Middle;
and when these Flowers fall off, they
are succeeded by small Heads, which resemble
those of the <em>Black Poppy</em>, and contain
a very small cineritious blackish Seed.
The Root is thick, divided into many
Parts, internally of a ligneous or woody
Nature, Saffron-coloured, bitter, and easily
deprived of its Bark: But I am acquainted
with no medicinal or other Quality
of which it is possessed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Plant grows in most Places of the
<em>Indies</em>, and especially those of a moist and
shady Nature, and in light well cultivated
Soils: It may be sown at all Seasons; but
when it appears above Ground it is to be
preserved from the Cold, and may be
transplanted for the Decoration of Garden-Walls;
for, like the <em>Citron-Tree</em>, it continues
green through the whole Year.</p>

<p>"The Leaves are only used; though when
these cannot be had, some use the Seeds in
their Stead. The Leaves are preserved by
passing a Thread through them, suspending
them in a shady Place, and thus drying
them, after which they are used either
whole or reduced to Powder.</p>

<p>"<em>Tobacco</em> is hot and dry, and consequently
heats, resolves, cleanses, and is a
little astringent, as will appear from these
following Virtues, of which it is possessed.</p>

<p>"The Leaves of <em>Tobacco</em> heated and applied,
prove an excellent Remedy for a
<em>Cephalæa</em>, and <em>Hemicrania</em>, provided these
Disorders arise from a cold Cause, or Flatulences,
but the Use of them is to be often
repeated, till the Disease is removed. Some,
before the Application of them, anoint the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Head with the Oil obtained from the
Flowers of the <em>Orange-Tree</em>. The same
Remedy is beneficial for a Rigidity of the
Neck or <em>Tetanus</em>, and for Pains of the
whole Body, arising from the same Cause.</p>

<p>"When a Tooth-ach proceeds from a
cold Cause, the wiping the affected Tooth
with a Linen-Cloth, soaked in the Juice
of <em>Tobacco</em>, and then putting a Piece of
the Leaf, made up in Form of a Pill,
into the Hollow, not only removes the
Pain, but also prevents the spreading of the
Corruption.</p>

<p>"A Decoction of Tobacco-Leaves with
Water, and a <em>Linctus</em> prepared of the same
Decoction, are beneficial in Disorders of
the Breast, inveterate Coughs, Asthma's,
and other similar Disorders proceeding
from cold Humours. A small Quantity
of a Syrup prepared of Sugar, and a Decoction
of the Leaves eliminates any putrid
Humours lodged in the Breast. The
Smoak of Tobacco-Leaves received into
the Mouth, sometimes affords Relief to
asthmatic Patients; but proper Evacuations
ought previously to be made, if the Patient's
Condition can possibly admit of it.</p>

<p>"Tobacco-Leaves heated under the Ashes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and applied to the Pit of the Stomach,
without shaking the Ashes off, afford Relief
to Persons afflicted with a Rumbling
of the Intestines, and Flatulencies. For
the same Purposes others bruise the Leaves
with their Hand, anointed with Oil, and
apply them to the Region of the Stomach.
The Leaves triturated in a little Vinegar,
long used by way of Ointment, and bound
upon the Parts affected, are beneficial in
Obstructions, or schirrous Tumours of the
Stomach and Spleen; but over this Preparation
warm Leaves, or a Cloth soaked
in the warm Juice of the Leaves, are to
be applied frequently every Day. When
the Leaves cannot be had, Snuff may be
mixed with any deobstruent Ointment,
and the obstructed or tumid Part long
anointed with it.</p>

<p>"The <em>Indian</em> Women greatly extol the
Use of <em>Tobacco</em>, not only for Children, but
also for adult Persons who are afflicted
with Crudities of the Stomach; for after
anointing the <em>Abdomen</em> with Lamp-Oil,
the Leaves heated under the Ashes, and
applied opposite to the Stomach, on the
Breast and Back, concoct the Crudities,
and render the Body soluble, provided the
Application is repeated sufficiently often.
A small Quantity of the Juice of <em>Tobacco</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Leaves, concocted and depurated with
Sugar, expels both flat and round Worms
from the Intestines; but for answering
this End more effectually, the triturated
Leaves ought to be laid upon the Navel,
and a proper Clyster injected.</p>

<p>"The Leaves heated under the Ashes, and
applied as hot as the Patient can bear, afford
great Relief in nephritic and flatulent
Pains, provided the Remedy be sufficiently
often repeated. <em>Tobacco</em> is also
in many Cases an useful Ingredient in
Clysters, Fomentations, and Plaisters.</p>

<p>"In Suffocations of the <em>Uterus</em>, the
Leaves rendered sufficiently hot, and applied
to the Navel, and Region of the
<em>Uterus</em>, afford present Relief; and if a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deliquium</i> should succeed, which it frequently
does, the Patient will be forthwith
roused from it by blowing the Smoak of
<em>Tobacco</em> up her Nostrils. This Practice is
so common among the <em>Indian</em> Women,
that for this very Reason they carefully
preserve and greatly esteem <em>Tobacco</em> Leaves.
Some for uterine Disorders previously apply
odorous Substances to the Navel, and
then lay <em>Tobacco</em> Leaves over them: But
the most proper Substances for this Purpose,
are <em>Tachamahach</em>, Oil of liquid <em>Am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>ber</em>,
<em>Peruvian</em> Balsams, <em>Caranna</em>, or a
Plaister of all these together worn daily
on the Navel.</p>

<p>"<em>Arthritic</em> Pains, provided the Humours
are cold, or at least are not too hot,
are greatly relieved by the Application of
the warm Leaves, or of a Linen-Cloth
soaked in the warm Juice of the Leaves;
for these resolve and digest the Humours;
for which Reason they are advantageously
laid upon &oelig;dematous Tumours, previously
washed with the warm Juice of the
Leaves.</p>

<p>"It is certain from Experience, that <em>Chilblanes</em>
are cured by rubbing them three
or four Times with <em>Tobacco</em> Leaves, and
then washing the Hands and Feet in
warm Water and Salt.</p>

<p>"A few Years ago <em>Tobacco</em> has been found
to resist Poison, even that of the most
virulent Kind, with which the <em>Cannibals</em>
taint their Arrows. It was formerly customary
to sprinkle <em>Sublimate</em> into the
Wounds thus inflicted; but the <em>Spaniards</em>
found a Method of subduing the Force
of the Poison by Means of <em>Tobacco</em>.</p>

<p>"A Company of <em>Cannibals</em> made an At-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>tack
upon a Body of <em>Indians</em> and <em>Spaniards</em>,
some of whom were killed and
others wounded with their poisoned Darts.
But as those who survived had no <em>Sublimate</em>,
they were advised by a certain
<em>Indian</em> to pour the expressed Juice of <em>Tobacco</em>
into their Wounds, and then apply
the triturated Leaves of the same Plant
to them, by which Means their Pains
were forthwith alleviated, the Symptoms
checked, the Force of the Poison subdued,
and the Wounds cured. This Accident
laid a Foundation for the subsequent
Use of <em>Tobacco</em> against Poisons; and the
King of <em>Spain</em>, in order to be convinced
of its Efficacy, ordered a Wound to be
made in the Throat of a Dog, and to be
anointed with the Poison used by Hunters;
soon after which a large Quantity
of the Juice of <em>Tobacco</em> was poured into
the Wound, and the triturated Leaves of
the Plant applied to it, by which Means
the Dog was effectually secured against
the Symptoms usually produced by Poisons.</p>

<p>"<em>Tobacco</em> Leaves laid upon pestilential
and malignant Carbuncles induce an <em>Eschar</em>,
and induce a Cure; nor are they
a less present efficacious Remedy against
the Bites of poisonous Animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Leaves, when laid upon recent
Wounds, immediately stop the <em>Hæmorrhage</em>,
and produce a Conglutination; but
if they are large, they ought to be previously
washed with Wine, their Lips
brought into Contact, and sprinkled with
the Juice of the Leaves, after which the
triturated Leaves are to be secured upon
the Wound: The same Measures are to
be taken the next and subsequent Days,
and a proper Regimen observed.</p>

<p>"An Instillation of the Juice, and an Application
of the triturated Leaves deterge,
cure, and cicatrise old Ulcers and Gangrenes;
provided due Evacuations are made,
a sufficient Quantity of Blood, if necessary,
is taken away, and a proper Regimen
observed.</p>

<p>"By this Means Ulcers are not only
cured in Men, but also in Animals. For
through all the <em>Indies</em>, Cows, Sheep, and
other Animals, are much subject to Ulcers,
which, on Account of the excessive
Humidity of the Climate, easily become
putrid, and full of Worms. In these
Ulcers it was sometimes customary to
sprinkle <em>Sublimate</em>, the Inhabitants being
destitute of better Remedies. But as this
Medicine is dear in that Part of the World,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
what was used for the Cure of these
Ulcers generally cost more than the Animal
was worth. For this Reason the
Inhabitants, conscious of the Efficacy of
<em>Tobacco</em> on Mankind, transferred its Use
to the putrid, fetid, and wormy Ulcers
of Animals; and accordingly found that
its Juice instilled into them, not only
killed the Worms, but also cleansed the
Ulcers, and induced a <em>Cicatrix</em>. <em>Tobacco</em>
is also good against the Gallings of Cattle,
for which Reason the <em>Indians</em> always carry
the Powder of it about with them.</p>

<p>"I knew a certain Person afflicted with
Ulcers of the Nostrils, which discharged
a seemingly contagious <em>Sanies</em>. By my
Advice he dropped the Juice of <em>Tobacco</em>
into them; after the second Instillation
a large Number of Worms fell away;
then a smaller Quantity and after a few
Days the Ulcers were cured, though the
Parts eroded were not restored. The rubbing
Ring-worms and Scall'd Heads with
<em>Tobacco</em> Leaves is also a beneficial Practice.</p>

<p>"<em>Tobacco</em> is the celebrated Plant used by
the <em>Indian</em> Priests before they give their
Responses; for it is customary among the
<em>Indians</em> to consult the Priests with respect
to the Event of Wars, and other Affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of Importance. Upon such Occasions, the
Priest consulted, burnt dry <em>Tobacco</em> Leaves,
received the Smoak of them into his
Mouth through a small Tube contrived for
that Purpose, then dropt down as it were
in an Extasy, lay totally destitute of Motion,
and remained in that Condition for
some Time. When the Fumes of the
<em>Tobacco</em> were discussed, he returned to
himself, told that he had communicated
the Affair to his Demon, and gave such
ambiguous Responses, that, whatever the
Event should be, the superstitious Crowd
might be easily perswaded, that he had
prophesied rightly. Thus the credulous
<em>Barbarians</em> are miserably hood-wink'd
by the impious and fraudulent Stratagems
of their Priests.</p>

<p>"The common People among the <em>Indians</em>
also receive the Smoak of <em>Tobacco</em>
into their Mouths and Nostrils, when they
want either to be transported with pleasant
Dreams, or to predict the Events of
their Affairs from the Occurrences which
happen to them during Sleep; for as the
grand Impostor, the Devil, knows the
Virtues of Herbs, he has taught them the
Qualities of <em>Tobacco</em>, in order to deceive
them by means of these Dreams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Various Plants, when chewed, or taken
internally, are observed to excite false and
delusory Representations and Ideas of Objects.
Thus <cite>Dioscorides</cite>, in Cap. de <cite>Solano
Maniaco, seu Furioso</cite>, tells us, that a
Dram of the Root of this Plant, drank in
Wine, produces false, tho' not unpleasant
Representations; that double the
Quantity produces an Alienation of
Mind, which lasts for three Days; and
that four Times the Quantity proves
mortal. It is also reported, that if a Person,
when he is going to sleep, eats <em>Aniseeds</em>,
they excite pleasant and agreeable
Dreams; whereas, the eating of <em>Horse-Raddish</em>
procures those of a turbulent and
ungrateful Kind.</p>

<p>"<cite>Garcias ab Orta</cite> informs us, that the
Juice of a certain Plant called <em>Bangue</em>,
mixed with some other Juices, produces
Alienation of Mind, excites Dreams, and
frees the Mind from all Anxiety and Uneasiness:
The like Effects are brought
about by <em>Opium</em>, which is much used by
the <em>East-Indians</em>, and concerning which
<cite>Garcias</cite> has treated very largely.</p>

<p>"The <em>Indians</em> also, when fatigued by
carrying Burdens, or by any other violent
Exercise, smoak <em>Tobacco</em>, by which Means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
they become as it were stupid, and fall
asleep; but when they awake, they find
themselves refreshed, and their Strength
repaired. The <em>Ethiopians</em> brought thither
as Slaves, following the Example of the
Natives, smoak <em>Tobacco</em> too frequently, for
which their Masters chastise them severely,
and burn their <em>Tobacco</em>, in order to deprive
them of an Opportunity of using it,
which, however, they continue to do secretly
and in private.</p>

<p>"<em>Tobacco</em> is also used by the <em>Indians</em> in
order to allay Hunger and Thirst; for
they calcine some Shells of River-Snails,
and by Trituration reduce them to a fine
Powder, of which, and <em>Tobacco</em> Leaves,
they take equal Parts, and chew them
together till they are reduced to a Kind of
Mass, which they form into Pills, larger
than a Pea: These they dry in a
Shade, and preserve for Use. When they
intend to travel through Desarts, where
they expect neither Meat nor Drink, they
take a sufficient Quantity of these Pills
along with them, put one between their
Under-Lip and Teeth, and constantly
suck the Liquor from it; so that when
one is consumed, they supply its Place
with another, and thus they perform a
three, and sometimes a four Days Jour-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>ney;
during which Time, they say, they
neither feel the Effects of Hunger nor
Thirst: The Reason of this probably is,
that as they continually suck these Pills,
they draw the pituitous Humours from
the Brain, which being swallowed, moisten
the Stomach, and allay its natural
Heat, but are at last consumed by it for
Want of other Aliments. Instances of a
similar Nature may be observed in many
Animals, which, during the whole <em>Winter</em>,
confine themselves to their Holes without
any Food; because the natural Heat of
the Stomach is employed in digesting and
consuming the Fat which they had gathered
in the <em>Winter</em>."</p>

<p>These are all the Virtues and Qualities
of <em>Tobacco</em> known to <cite>Monardus</cite>: But, besides
this, <cite>Zacutus</cite>, in <cite>Observat. Lib. 1. de
Medic. Princip. Histor.</cite> informs us, that he
had often found the Juice of <em>Tobacco</em> effectual
for the Cure of an <em>Alopecia</em> or Falling off
of the Hairs: Nor is this to be wondered at,
since, as the Medicine indicated ought to bear
an Analogy to the indicating Symptoms, as
<em>Tobacco</em> is hot and dry, resolvent, cleansing,
and somewhat astringent; and as all these
Qualities are, according to <cite>Galen</cite>, indicated
in an <em>Alopecia</em>, <em>Zacutus</em> might succeed in
the Cure of it by means of <em>Tobacco</em>. I re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>member
two Girls, who being indisposed,
had a <em>Lixivium</em>, in which dry <em>Tobacco</em>
Leaves were macerated, prescribed for taking
the Scales off their Heads; but the one was
seized with a gentle <em>Vertigo</em>, and the other
thought she perceived herself, as it were,
drunk. But I mention these Accidents for
the Sake of young Practitioners, without any
Design to discourage them from applying
<em>Tobacco</em> and its Preparations to other Parts
of the Body; for the celebrated <cite>Hartmann</cite>
seems to have thought the Essence of the
green Leaves of <em>Tobacco</em>, obtained by Infusion
in <em>Malmsey</em> Wine, a Specific for the Cure
of the <em>Palsey</em>; and after a Sweat has been
procured, orders the paralytic Limbs to be
long rubbed with it; by which Means, he
says, he has often seen them happily restored.</p>

<p>Though <em>Tobacco</em> is a valuable Herb, yet
the Abuse of it, which we shall afterwards
consider, is intolerable, and highly noxious.
Besides, <cite>Monardus</cite>, <cite>Ægidius Everartus</cite>, in
1587, at <em>Antwerp</em>, published a beautiful
Commentary upon the Virtues and Uses of
<em>Tobacco</em>: And when the same Work was reprinted
at <em>Utrecht</em> in 1644, various Treatises
concerning <em>Tobacco</em> were added to it; such
as the <cite>Misocapnus</cite>, or a Treatise on the Abuse
of <em>Tobacco</em>, taken from the Works of King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
<em>James</em> the Sixth of <em>England</em>; <cite>Tobacologia
Johannis Neandri</cite>. <cite>Epistolæ ac Judicia clarissimorum
aliquot Medicorum</cite>; and the <cite>Hymnus
Tabaci Raphaelis Thorii</cite>. After these
Authors appeared <cite>Chrysostomus Magnenus</cite>,
Professor of Medicine in the University of <em>Padua</em>,
who in 1648, published very learned Exercitations
concerning <em>Tobacco</em>. Not only from
the Authors already mentioned, but also from
<cite>Andreas Cæsalpinus</cite>; <cite>Dalechampius's Historia
generalis Plantarum</cite>; <cite>Lobelii Adversaria</cite>,
<cite>Clusius in his Notæ ad Monardum</cite>;
<cite>Dodonæus</cite>; <cite>Tabernamontanus</cite>; <cite>Nardi Antonii
Recchi Res Medicæ Novæ Hispaniæ,
cum Terentii Lyncei Notis</cite>, we learn what is
the native Soil of <em>Tobacco</em>, and how the
knowledge of it was introduced into <em>Europe</em>
after the Discovery of <em>America</em> by <em>Christopher
Columbus</em> and <em>Americus Vesputius</em>. Some
of these Authors have also described its
Virtues and Use, whilst others of them have
treated very fully concerning the Abuse of it.
Following the Example of these great Men,
I shall proceed, without any Partiality, and
with that Freedom which is always peculiar
to Truth. This is certainly a difficult Attempt,
considering the Opposition and Prejudice
with which I have to grapple. But
before I proceed, I shall take Notice of the
Error of <cite>Libavius</cite>, who, according to <cite>Magnenus</cite>
in <cite>Exercitat. 1. Par. 1.</cite> asserts, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
<em>Tobacco</em> was a Native of <em>Europe</em>, since it was
found in the almost inaccessible Places of
the <em>Hercynian</em> Forest: But adds this Author,
<cite>Who denies that Seeds are dispersed, and
carried every where by the Winds?</cite> But it is
by no means probable, that the Seeds of
<em>Tobacco</em>, which, comparatively speaking, are
as small as the Atoms of <em>Democritus</em>, could,
by a Whirlwind, be conveyed to the <em>Hercynian</em>
Forest in <em>Germany</em>, from <em>France</em>, <em>Italy</em>,
or <em>Spain</em>, much less from <em>America</em>. This
is a Plant of a particular specific Kind, and
the Native of <em>America</em>: Neither does any
Historian mention such a Whirlwind for the
Dispersion of its Seeds. It is true, Mount
<em>Ætna</em> in <em>Sicily</em>, and Mount <em>Hecla</em> in <em>Iceland</em>,
by their sulphureous Eruptions, throw the
Ashes to a vast Distance: But it does not
to me seem probable, that the Air should
ever be in such a gyratory Motion, as to convey
Seeds from one Quarter of the World
to another, or from one Country to another,
though it is not to be denied but they may
be carried from a Plain to a rising Ground,
or from one Garden to another adjacent to it.</p>

<p>Those Authors, who have called <em>Tobacco</em>
<em>Herba rixosa</em>, the Strife-producing Herb, and
<em>Herba insana</em>, the Plant which excites Madness,
seem not to have been very much in
the wrong; for what is more frequent than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
for People of all Denominations to spend
the whole of the Day smoaking <em>Tobacco</em> in
Ale-Houses and Taverns? Nay, so fond
are young and old Men of <em>Tobacco</em>, that the
Father forgets the Interests of the Son, and
the Son those of the Father for its Sake.
Thus some Men use large Quantities of
<em>Tobacco</em>, whilst, perhaps, their Families are
starving at Home: Whereas some Children
spend upon <em>Tobacco</em> what their industrious
Parents had, with Toil and Care, amassed for
their Use. Nay, such is the Madness of
some <em>Europeans</em>, that they will, for a Trifle,
dispose of their Goods, in order to gratify
themselves with <em>Tobacco</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>King <cite>James</cite> the Sixth of <em>England</em> tells us,
"that, among the <em>Americans</em>, a Servant addicted
to the Smoaking of <em>Tobacco</em>, can
hardly find a Purchaser; so odious is that
Custom to the Authors of it themselves."
We <em>Europeans</em>, however, are so infatuated
and hood-winked, as yearly to sail to <em>America</em>,
spare no Expences, and expose ourselves
not only to Storms and Tempests, but also to
Sickness and Death, for the Sake of <em>Tobacco</em>;
and it is certain, that our Men, on their Return
from <em>America</em>, spread through all <em>Europe</em>
the <em>Neapolitan</em> Disease, which, as <cite>Fiorovanta</cite>
thinks, was endemial to the <em>Americans</em>,
on Account of their eating human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Flesh. This, to use the Phrase of <cite>Agrippa,
de Vanitat. Scientiarum</cite>, Cap. 84. <cite>is to purchase
Death at a great Price</cite>. The <em>Indians</em>
and <em>Barbarians</em> have such an Aversion to the
Abuse of <em>Tobacco</em>, that they severely chastise
the <em>Ethiopians</em> and Slaves for it, and burn
their <em>Tobacco</em>; probably, because they suspect
that it renders them valetudinary, and disables
them to work; in which Situation they
are a Burthen upon their Masters. According
to <cite>Viganenus</cite>, in <cite>Lib. de Ritibus Moribusq</cite>;
<cite>Turcarum</cite>; and <cite>Johannes Chrysostomus
Magnenus</cite>, in <cite>Exercitat. de Tabac. Exercit.</cite>
6. §. 10. <cite>Amureth</cite>, the 4th Emperor of the
<em>Turks</em>, by an Edict, prohibited the Use of
<em>Tobacco</em>, under Pain of Death, lest, by the
Abuse of it, his Subjects should become effeminate,
feeble, and barren. According to
<cite>Adamus Olearius</cite>, in <cite>Lib. 3. Cap. 6.</cite> the Emperor
of <em>Muscovy</em>, in 1634, by an Edict prohibited
the Importation of <em>Tobacco</em> and <em>Snuff</em>
into his Territories, under the Penalty of
being beat with Rods, and having the Nostrils
slit in Case of Disobedience: And the
same Author says, he saw some who had
these Marks of Infamy inflicted upon them.
In <cite>Lib. 5. Cap. 31.</cite> he also tells us, that <cite>Schach
Abas</cite>, the <em>Persian</em> Monarch, prohibited all
Use of <em>Tobacco</em> in that Army, which he raised
against <cite>Tameran Chan</cite> under the Penalty
of the Offender's having his Nose and Lips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
cut off; nay, he was so rigid, or rather cruel
in his Discipline, that when a certain <em>Persian</em>,
ignorant of the Edict, came into his Camp
with some <em>Tobacco</em> to sell, he ordered both
him and his Commodities to be thrown into
one Funeral Pile and burnt.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These, and other similar Examples, might
perhaps have a lucky Influence on some <em>Europeans</em>,
unless the Custom of using <em>Tobacco</em>
had become so prevalent and universal, that
<cite>James</cite> the Sixth said he believed "that a
whole Wood in <em>England</em> would hardly afford
Trees enough for hanging the Dealers
in <em>Tobacco</em>." <cite>Hoffman</cite>, in <cite>Lib. 2. de
Medicam Officinal. Cap. 3.</cite> informs us, "that
this Prince, in the University of <em>Oxford</em>,
disputed publickly against the Use of <em>Tobacco</em>,
giving Instances of Persons who
used it, who were afflicted with incurable
Disorders of the Breast, Deliriums,
Watchings, and Convulsions; and after
whose Death, the Lungs were found
black and parched, just as if they had been
indurated in Smoak." The same <cite>Hoffman</cite>
informs us, that he was told by some
Soldiers who had resided in <em>Holland</em>, "that
upon dissecting the Heads of some Snuff-takers,
who had been executed, they observed,
that the whole internal Part of
what Anatomists call the <em>Patera</em> of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Brain, was black with Snuff." He was
also told by <cite>Patricius Noræus</cite>, "that in
the last <em>Bohemian</em> War, he saw all the
Heads of the <em>English</em> Soldiers, who were
killed, in the same Condition." <cite>Nardus
Antonius Recchus</cite>, in <cite>Lib. 5. Rer. Medicar.
Nov. Hisp.</cite> observes, "that those who use
<em>Tobacco</em> too frequently, become ill coloured,
have a squalid, sordid Tongue, a
Palpitation of the Throat, and a preter-natural
Heat of the Liver, and fall into
Cachexies and Dropsies, by which they
are at last cut off." Thus they suffer for
their Folly in gratifying themselves in so preposterous
a Manner.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But without expatiating farther upon
Things so obvious, let it suffice to have
warned the Reader of his Danger, by the
foregoing Observations. That Smoaking is
more prejudicial and injurious than Snuffing,
I think may be justly asserted, if we consider
the Instances which Anatomists give us of
the Effects produced by each, which we
shall hereafter do: I must, however, here
observe, that we cannot enough admire the
Zeal of <cite>James</cite> the Sixth of <em>England</em>, for the
Good of his Subjects; since, in the last Words
of his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Misocapnus</i>, he expostulates with them
in the following pathetic and affectionate
Manner: "At last, therefore, O Citizens, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
you have any Sense of Shame, or Dread of
Infamy, left in your Bosoms, lay aside the
Use of <em>Tobacco</em>, a Custom attended with
Ignominy, received through Error, and
established by Stupidity. By its Means
the Wrath of Heaven is excited against us,
the Health of our Bodies impaired, our
Substance wasted, and the Dignity of our
Nation not only diminished at Home,
but also despised Abroad; for <em>Tobacco</em> is
a Substance loathsome to the Sight, disagreeable
to the Smell, noxious to the Brain,
injurious to the Lungs, and, by its Clouds
of black Smoak, nearly resembling the
horrid Steams of Hell."</p>

<p>If any Champion for the Interests of <em>Tobacco</em>,
deaf to my salutary Instructions, should
ask me whether I would have the Pope, the
Emperor, and all the Kings, Electors, Princes,
and Dukes in <em>Europe</em>, prohibit and discharge
the Use of <em>Tobacco</em>? I answer, that
such a Revolution is really to be wished
for, on Account of the Abuses of <em>Tobacco</em>
before enumerated. But, before I proceed
to give a fuller Answer, I would have the
Person who asks this Question, attentively
listen to the following sublime and truly
noble Sentiments of <cite>Seneca</cite>, in <cite>Lib. de Vita
Beata, Cap. 1.</cite> "Nothing, <em>says he</em>, is more
worthy in itself, nor more becoming the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Dignity of a free-born Soul, than not, like
the Cattle, implicitly to follow the Van of
the Flock, going, not whither we ought
to go, but whither they go before us.
But nothing involves us in more terrible
Misfortunes, than our judging of Things
by Fame and Report, esteeming those
Things best, which are most universally
assented to, and approved, as we find in
numberless Instances. We neither live
agreeably to the Dictates of Reason, nor
in a Manner that is uniform and consistent
with itself: Hence it is, that such
Numbers of Individuals fall, as it were,
upon others. In a large and crowded
Army, none falls without drawing another
along with him, and the foremost prove
fatal to those who succeed them. The
like happens in every Part and Circumstance
of human Life; for it is the universal
Practice to impose upon our own
Reasons, and, by that Means prove the
Cause of Errors to others." It is therefore
to be lamented, that we <em>Europeans</em>
should thus brutally follow the Custom of
the <em>Barbarians</em>, without listening to Reason,
in which we so far excel them, since, to
use the Expressions of <cite>Salust</cite>, "They are
addicted to Intemperance and Sleep, so
rude and uncultivated, that they seem to
lead the Life of Brutes, rather than that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
of Men, since they indulge themselves in
Voluptuousness, whilst their Souls are a
Burthen to them." In a word, they live
in a no less brutal Manner, than the Inhabitants
of the Main Land of <em>Africa</em>, who, according
to <cite>Hippocrates</cite>, in <cite>Lib. de Morbo sacra</cite>,
"lie upon Goat-Skins, and eat Goat's
Flesh, without any Bed-Cloths, or Garments,
or Shoes, except what are made of
Goat-Skins." The <em>Americans</em> are still
worse, since they feed upon human Flesh,
have nothing to cover them, and pass their
Time in desart Places, and lurking Holes.
Since, therefore, the Climate, Soil, and
Non-Naturals of the <em>Americans</em>, are widely
different from those of the <em>Europeans</em>, it
is highly reasonable, that we should neither
admit, nor tolerate, the continual and habitual
Use of <em>Tobacco</em> in <em>Europe</em>.</p>

<p><cite>Cornelius Agrippa</cite>, in <cite>Lib. de Vanitat. Scient.
Cap. 84.</cite> seems, with a good deal of
Reason, to think, "That it would greatly
contribute, not only to the Health of Mankind,
but also to the Interests of particular
States, to prohibit the Importation of foreign
and exotic Drugs, which are often
counterfeited, or adulterated, by those who
deal in them, to the great Detriment of
the State." No less salutary and reasonable
is that Law enacted at <em>Rome</em> by <cite>Nero</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
which runs in the following Tenor: "Apothecaries
are hereby injoined, to use no
other Medicines, but those found in <em>Italy</em>,
since these are not only better suited and
adopted to the Constitutions of <em>Romans</em>,
but may also be had far fresher, more genuine,
and with less Difficulty, Expences,
and Danger, than foreign Medicines, the
most of which are justly to be suspected,
as sophisticated, spurious, spoiled in the
Ship, corrupted by Age, or not collected
at due Seasons, or in proper Places." Since
the Diseases described by the Antients, sometimes
seize the <em>Europeans</em>, though with new
and uncommon Symptoms; and since new
Diseases also appear in <em>Europe</em>, I think it is
not to be doubted, but the Meats, Fruits,
and other Delicacies, sent from <em>Asia</em>, <em>Africa</em>,
and <em>America</em>, into <em>Europe</em>, are, in some Measure,
the Sources of our Calamities.</p>

<p>But, without any farther Digression, I shall
confine myself to the Abuse of <em>Tobacco</em>. That
<em>Tobacco</em>, when used with Prudence and Propriety,
is a salutary Medicine, I do not deny;
since I myself use it with great Advantage
in the <em>Spring</em> and <em>Autumn</em>, at which
Seasons I am afflicted with catarrhous Defluxions.
Most People, when only seized
with a gentle Cough, are so cautious, as not
to venture upon a small Dose of the Syrup of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Violets, or Liquorice, without consulting
their Physicians, Friends, and Nurses; but
vast Numbers of the <em>Europeans</em>, without any
Advice, greatly incommode and disturb the
Brain, the Seat of their Reason, by using the
highly penetrating Smoak of <em>Tobacco</em>, in the
Morning and Evening, in the Night as well
as the Day, and in all States and Constitutions
of the Weather, calm and serene, as
well as cloudy and over-cast. Let us therefore
lay aside this barbarous Custom, so fatal
and prejudicial to Health.</p>

<p>Besides, it is probable, that the crafty
<em>Americans</em>, sensible of the vast Quantity of
<em>Tobacco</em> yearly imported into <em>Europe</em>, may,
for the Sake of Gain, impose upon us; for it
is certain, that our own Merchants, influenced
by a base and sordid Principle of Avarice,
have long ago found Methods of adulterating
<em>Tobacco</em> by Means of Brine, Lemons,
Vinegar, Wine, and Euphorbium. But with
respect to these Frauds, the Reader may
consult <cite>Neander</cite> in his <cite>Tabacologia</cite>. Besides,
it is hardly credible, that the Roaps brought
from <em>America</em>, under the Name of <em>Tobacco</em>,
consist intirely of good and sound <em>Tobacco</em>
Leaves: For almost every one knows, that
the Marks of the Goodness of <em>Tobacco</em>, whether
drawn from the Colour, Smell, Taste,
or Weight, vary very greatly among the <em>Eu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>ropeans</em>,
who, to their Disgrace be it said,
have learned to hang their <em>Tobacco</em>, when
corrupted, insipid, or light, in Houses of Office,
or Vaults, in order to be rendered more
acrid and ponderous by the volatile Salts of
human Urine and Excrements, under a specious
Pretence, that these Salts render it
beneficial and salutary, by cleansing the
Head; which, they say, is highly beneficial
to Persons who drink much. But
this is certainly an improper and prejudicial
Method of treating the Head, and evacuating
its Excrements; concerning the copious
Production of which, by means of the corrupted
Temperature of the Brain in Persons
who daily smoak <em>Tobacco</em>, we shall afterwards
treat.</p>

<p>Having premised these Things, we now
come to decide a Question lately begun to be
agitated, namely, Whether Snuffing or Smoaking
is the more innocent and safe Custom?
I affirm, then, that both are generally pernicious,
and none of them to be recommended
to any one without great Caution
and Deliberation: Though I remember I was
formerly a Smoaker of <em>Tobacco</em>, yet, I am of
Opinion, that Snuffing is a less injurious and
hurtful Practice. Some are of Opinion, that
by the constant Use of Snuff, the Sight is
rendered more clear and penetrating; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
with how great Danger this Practice is accompanied,
is sufficiently confirmed by <cite>Adrianus
Spigelius</cite>, in <cite>Corp. human. Fabr. Lib.
7. Cap. 2.</cite> where he proposes a Problem, together
with its Answer, in the following
Words: "What is the Cause, why many
Persons, by often repeated Sternutations,
especially when industriously excited, suddenly
become blind? This happens, either
because the Ramifications of the caroted
Arteries, which are so near the Optic
Nerves as to touch them, are so filled,
as to compress them; or, because a large
Quantity of pituitous Humours is conveyed
from the Brain to the Optic Nerves,
which are thereby obstructed. When the
Disorder arose from the former of these
Causes, I have seen the Patients cured by a
<em>Seton</em>; but, when it proceeded from the
latter, I never remember to have seen it
cured." <cite>Joh. Chrysostomus Magnenus,</cite> in
<cite>Exercitat. 8. de Tabaco. §. 1.</cite> affirms, "that
by violent Sternutation, some Persons have
died; since by it the Head has been so
strongly agitated, as by the Effort to burst
the <em>Meninges</em>, and relax the <em>Compages</em> of
the Brain." And this Opinion he confirms
by the Example of a certain Baker,
mentioned by <cite>Famianus Strada</cite>, "who, when
he had twenty-four Sternutations immediately
succeeding each other, died of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the twenty-fifth, by the violent Shock, of
which the Arteries of the Brain, and Membranes
surrounding it, were broken." The
same Author, in <cite>Sect. 4.</cite> of the last-cited
Chapter, affirms, "That he saw a certain
Man, who by the excessive Use of Snuff,
had the chrystaline Humours of his Eyes
corrugated, so that all Objects seemed to
be in a Kind of fluctuating Motion before
him."</p>

<p>If it should be objected, that such Accidents
are rare; I answer, that though they
are rare, yet they are not impossible; and,
what has happened to some, may also be the
Fate of others. Though, therefore, the <em>Falx</em>
of the <em>Dura Mater</em>, and the <em>Torcular</em> of <em>Herophilus</em>,
the fatal Seat of an <em>Apoplexy</em>, are
not forthwith so disordered as to yawn by
Snuffing, yet the Interests of the Five Senses
are but ill consulted, by often drawing from
the Brain with Snuff, what we call <em>Snot</em> or
<em>Mucus</em>, which is evacuated through the Nose;
or rather, according to <cite>Galen</cite>, and other Anatomists,
through the <em>Os Ethmoides</em>, which is
the Organ of Smell, but not at all destined
for eliminating the Excretions of the Brain.
Thus Persons who use Snuff to Excess, instead
of bettering, rather impair their Sight,
and for their Pains generally lose the Sense
of Smelling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>As the Person who, for his Crimes, has
lost his Ears, is looked upon with Infamy;
what better Treatment does he deserve, who,
either through a Contempt of Medicine, or
an obstinate Fondness to gratify his own
Inclinations, either impairs or destroys those
Senses, which indulgent Heaven has bestowed
upon him for so noble Purposes! With
respect to Instances of this Misfortune, and
the Reasons why it happens, <cite>Magnenus</cite> in
<cite>Tr. de Abusu Tabaci, Exercitat. 6. Sect. 15.</cite>
speaks in the following Manner: "The Sense
of Smelling, as I have been told by many,
who have either snuffed or smoaked to
Excess, is abolished by the Abuse of <em>Tobacco</em>,
because the mamillary Processes are
thereby dried, so that when they are rendered
drier than the Effluvia exciting the
Perception of any Smell, they cannot be
duly acted upon by such Effluvia; for
Smell, according to <cite>Aristotle</cite>, in <cite>Lib. 3.
de Animal.</cite> consists in the dry Effluvia surpassing
the Moisture of these Processes;
so that the common Sensory may have a
Change produced in it by proper and adequate
Objects." <cite>Magnenus</cite> also, in <cite>Exercitat.
28. Sect. 1.</cite> tells us, "That he knew
a Man, who, in one Day, snuffed four
Ounces." After which, he proceeds to
enquire into the Advantages and Injuries attending
the Use of Snuff; and to consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
why it excites Sternutation in those who are
not accustomed to it, but not in those who
are. This accurate Author also, among other
Reasons against the excessive Use of Snuff,
advances this, that it may enter the Passages
of the <em>Os Ethmoides</em>, form itself into <em>Concretions</em>,
and there lodge for a great while.
Hence, it is sufficiently obvious, that when
the Passages and Perforations of this Bone are
obstructed by Snuff, the Air can neither have
Access to the Brain for its Ventilation, nor
can the Effluvia of odorous Bodies be conveyed
to it; in Consequence of which, the
Sense of Smelling must necessarily be lost.
Though this should, perhaps, be looked upon
as a trifling and inconsiderable Loss; yet
Snuff, by its highly narcotic, heating, drying,
penetrating, and unctuous Qualities, has
such an unlucky Influence on the eighth
Pair of Nerves of <em>Spigellius</em>, or the first of
<em>Bartholin</em>, which are appropriated to Smelling,
that it gradually impairs, and, in process
of Time, totally destroys that Sense; because
this Pair of Nerves is conveyed to the mamillary
Processes, which are situated in the interior
Part of the Brain, near the <em>Os Ethmoides</em>,
which is covered with the <em>Dura Mater</em>. Since,
therefore, a large Quantity of Snuff is violently
attracted towards the Root of the Nose;
and since, according to the Doctrine of <cite>Hippocrates</cite>,
Nature is never one Moment idle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
in a living Body, all whose Parts are pervious
and transparable, it must necessarily happen,
that the Parts subservient to the Sense of
Smelling must be greatly injured by the narcotic
Quality of Snuff. Having said thus
much of the Misfortunes produced by excessive
Snuffing, we now come to consider
those attending the Abuse of Smoaking;
in doing which, we shall confine ourselves
to Examples, which have a better Effect on
the Vulgar, than the nice and fine-spun
Deductions of a Philosopher's Reason.</p>

<p>It is therefore certain that <em>Tobacco</em> is possessed
of an highly penetrating Quality. Thus
the celebrated <cite>Heurnius</cite>, in <cite>Lib. 1. Method.
ad Prax.</cite> speaks of it in the following Manner:
"<em>Tobacco</em>, when smoaked, produces
very singular Effects, since it draws a surprizing
Quantity of Phlegm from the
Mouth and Nostrils: The Smoak arising
from its dry Leaves laid upon live Coals,
when received into the Mouth by a Funnel,
pervades the whole Brain, and is
also conveyed to the Ears, and <em>Uterus</em>.
But I can affirm, that this Herb is, in a
peculiar Manner, appropriated to the Brain;
easily conveys its Virtues thither, and evacuates
all its <em>Sordes</em>: For, about a Year
ago, when I was afflicted with the Tooth-ach,
I made a Decoction of <em>Tobacco</em> with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Water, adding some <em>Camomile</em> Flowers:
A Spoonful of this Decoction, when tepid,
I put in my Mouth, and spit it out
some Time after; and this I did for two
Hours; by which Means my Pain was
considerably alleviated. Next Day, when
I went to my Garden, and stooped to
pull up a Weed, a large Quantity of a
Saffron-coloured Liquor, which smelled
like <em>Tobacco</em>, flowed from my Nose, upon
which my Tooth-ach was immediately
removed. During the whole of my Life,
neither Blood, nor any other Liquor, except
a ferous Phlegm, had flowed from
my Nose, but upon this Occasion I never
saw any Liquor of a deeper yellow Colour."
Other similar Accounts of the penetrating
Quality of <em>Tobacco</em>, I have had from
my old Master, <cite>Henningus Arnesæus</cite>, Physician
to <cite>Christianus</cite>, the fourth King of
<em>Denmark</em>, who affirmed, "That not only
the Smoak of <em>Tobacco</em>, but also that of
every other Substance received by the
Mouth, was penetrating on Account of its
Acrimony; in Consequence of which, it
must pervade and alter the whole Substance
of the Brain, both <em>Meninges</em>, and
all the Vessels, and Contents of them."
Besides, as the Smoak of <em>Tobacco</em> is hot, proceeding
immediately from kindled <em>Tobacco</em>;
and as, according to <cite>Aristotle</cite>, it is the Pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>perty
of Heat to collect homogeneous, and
separate heterogeneous Substances, it must
necessarily happen, in the very Nature of
Things, that this Smoak should fuse and
colliquate the Phlegm, the Receptacle of
which is the Brain, which, according to
<cite>Hippocrates</cite>, is the largest of all the Glands.
I do not in the least doubt of the Truth of
<cite>Arnesæus</cite>'s Opinion; for I think that all the
Fore-runners of Catarrhs, such as Sternutations,
Spittings, and Discharges of Saliva,
are produced by Heat, which is the necessary
Cause of Catarrhs, though not the productive
Cause of the morbific Matter. Thus the
celebrated <cite>Hoffman</cite>, in <cite>Lib. 3. Institut. Medic.
Cap. 193.</cite> informs us, "That Heat
alone, and, for the most part, of the external
Kind, such as that of the Sun, or that
procured by Exercise, Wine, and Aromatics,
among which are <em>Cinnamon</em> and
<em>Saffron</em>, with which we so plentifully season
our Aliments, is sufficient to fuse and
colliquate the Phlegm, or acrid Serum."
Thus a Pipe filled with the burned Wicks of
Candles, gathered out of Snuffers, or with
a Piece of Match used in discharging Cannons,
or with a Piece of bituminous, fossile
Earth, especially that of <em>Holland</em>, will procure
as copious a Spitting, as a Pipe of the
best <em>Virginian</em> Tobacco. Soldiers also, and
Sailors, produce the same Pleasure and Ef<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>fects
in themselves by smoaking kindled Paper,
as are produced by smoaking <em>Tobacco</em>.
Since, therefore, acrid Smoak and Heat of
every Kind, conveyed to the Brain, fuse the
Phlegm, and eliminate it by the <em>Os Ethmoides</em>
and <em>Sph&oelig;noides</em>, the Nose and the Palate of
the Mouth, I see no Reason why <em>Heurnius</em>
should affirm, "That it has a surprizing
Faculty of drawing the Phlegm from the
Mouth and Nostrils; that it is peculiarly
adapted to the Brain, easily conveys its
Virtues thither, and eliminates all its
Sordes."</p>

<p>As <em>Tobacco</em> is hot, dry, unctuous, and penetrating;
it must, on account of these Qualities,
soon take Flame: And, as it is possessed
of an highly narcotic Quality, it, by its
narcotic Sulphur, stupifies those who use it,
corrupts the Temperature of the Brain, and
destroys its Tone; whereas, the moderate
Smoaking of <em>Marjoram</em>, <em>Betony</em>, <em>Rosemary</em>,
<em>Amber</em>, and other Substances of a like Nature,
would eliminate the Phlegm more safely,
and without producing any of these ill
Consequences. This narcotic Quality of <em>Tobacco</em>,
is the Reason why great Smoakers are,
during the whole of their Lives, afflicted
with a continual Spitting, as I have observed
in <cite>Histor. Pompinellæ Class. secund. Quadripartit.</cite>
Though by the frequent Use of <em>To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>bacco</em>,
a large Quantity of Phlegm is eliminated
from the Brain; this Plant is not,
therefore, a peculiar Specific, adapted to that
Organ: For, on the contrary, since it manifestly
abounds with a narcotic Sulphur, it is
highly injurious, not only to the Nerves, but
also to the whole Substance of the Brain.
Hence, as I observed before, many Users of
<em>Tobacco</em>, not only have their olfactory Nerves
so injured by its narcotic Sulphur, as to lose
the Sense of Smelling, but are also observed
not to have a very exquisite Taste, the fourth
and seventh Pairs of Nerves being affected.
Persons of this Kind are also observed to be
fond of Malt Liquors, and to complain of a
languid Appetite; because the sixth Pair of
Nerves, which descends into the Stomach, is
stupified by the narcotic Sulphur of the <em>Tobacco</em>:
It is, therefore, absurd to maintain,
that <em>Tobacco</em> is of a cephalic Quality, and peculiarly
adapted to the Disorders of the Head,
since it is so unfriendly to the Nerves as to
produce a Stupor in them. It is more reasonable
to argue thus: <em>Tobacco</em> is hot, consists
of very subtle Parts, and is highly penetrating;
therefore, being at the same Time
narcotic, it will prove the more hurtful, the
more penetrating it is; because the narcotic
Quality of <em>Tobacco</em>, which is otherwise slow,
like that of <em>Opium</em>, or <em>Hemlock</em>, is, by its
other Qualities, exalted, and put in Action;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
or, to speak my Sentiments more freely, by
means of the Acrimony ascribed to its Salt,
whether fixed or volatile, the narcotic Sulphur
is conveyed in its full Strength to the Nerves
of the Head. That this Sulphur remains
pretty long intire, even in a living Person, is
sufficiently evinced, by that Saffron-coloured
Liquor, smelling like <em>Tobacco</em>, which was
discharged from the Nostrils of <em>Heurnius</em>,
next Day after the Abuse of a Decoction of
<em>Tobacco</em> and <em>Camomile</em> Flowers. I would
not have any one imagine, that as soon as he
lays by his Pipe, his Brain is no longer heated
by the Smoak, which, for two or three Days
after, he smells, or expires, when he sneezes.
Thus, this narcotic, unctuous, and strong-smelled
Sulphur, adhering to the Membranes,
Ventricles, Gyrations, or other latent
Passages of the Brain, and being left
alone without either Smoak or Heat, gradually
and insensibly corrupts the whole
Mass of the Brain, by which Means <em>Tobacco</em>-Smoakers
are obliged to spit and expectorate
continually. When the Brain is thus weakened
by the copious Spitting excited by the
narcotic Sulphur, neither the <em>Tonsils</em> nor the
<em>Thymus</em>, which are destined for imbibing the
natural excrementitious Humours of the
Brain, are any longer fit for that Purpose.
When such an Accident happens, the <em>Tobacco</em>-Smoaker
begins to yawn, to have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
hoarse and shrill Voice, and a stinking Breath,
like those labouring under a <em>Lues Venerea</em>.</p>

<p>I think I have now sufficiently proved,
that as <em>Tobacco</em> is of a narcotic Quality, and
its Fumes penetrate intimately into the Brain,
so, of course, Smoaking must be more prejudicial
than Snuffing. But, if People will
still obstinately indulge themselves in the
Use of this noxious Plant, all I can do farther,
is to warn them of their Danger.</p>

ON<br />

<em>TEA</em>.</h2>
</div>

<p>I Have hitherto strenuously endeavoured
to preserve the Health of the <em>Europeans</em>,
by discarding and exploding the Abuse
of <em>Tobacco</em>: But if any one should ask my
Sentiments of <em>Tea</em>, which some Years ago
began to be imported from <em>Asia</em>, and the
<em>Eastern</em> Countries, and which has Qualities
quite contrary to <em>Tobacco</em>, since it prevents
Sleep, and therefore is by some Authors
highly commended as an excellent Cephalic,
and very grateful to the <em>Viscera</em>, subservient
to Nutrition: I answer, that no satisfactory
Reply can be made, till we know the Genus
and Species of <em>Tea</em>, and to what Species of
<em>European</em> Herbs it may be referred or compared;
for <em>Tobacco</em> is by us called the <em>Peruvian
Hyosciamius</em>, but we give no Name of
any of our Plants to <em>Tea</em>: Nay, it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
known, whether <em>Tea</em> is what the <em>Greeks</em> call
Ποα, an Herb, or Θαμνίσκιον, a Shrub, which
Words, according to <cite>Ruellius</cite>, <cite>Morantha</cite>, and
others, are so confounded by <cite>Dioscorides</cite>,
<cite>Theophrastus</cite>, and other Botanists, as to occasion
great Disputes among the Learned. But
the Authors, who have most faithfully collected
whatever has been wrote upon <em>Tea</em>, either
in the <em>Spanish</em>, <em>French</em>, <em>Latin</em>, <em>English</em>, or
<em>Dutch</em> Languages, are <cite>Nicolaus Tulpius</cite>, and
<cite>Nicolaus Trigautius</cite>, from the Works of
whom I shall enquire,</p>

<p><em>1st</em>, Of what Kind and Species the Herb
<em>Tea</em> is?</p>

<p><em>2d</em>, Whether <em>Tea</em> is only the Produce of
<em>Asia</em>, and whether it is ever found in <em>Europe</em>,
or not? And,</p>

<p><em>3d</em>, Which of the <em>European</em> Herbs may
be most properly used in its Stead.</p>

<p><cite>Tulpius</cite>, then, speaks in the following
Manner: "In the <em>East Indies</em> nothing is
more common than drinking the Decoction
of an Herb, which the <em>Chinese</em> call
<em>Thee</em>, and the <em>Japonese</em>, <em>Tchia</em>. As my
Accounts of this Plant were received from
the best and most impartial Authors, I shall
willingly hand them down to Posterity.
The Herb <em>Tea</em>, therefore, has long acumi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>nated
Leaves crenated about the Edges.
Its Roots are fibrous, and divided into
very small Shreds. It grows not only in
<em>China</em> and <em>Japan</em>, but also in <em>Chiam</em>, only
the Leaves of the <em>Chinese Tea</em> are of a
blackish green Colour: Whereas the <em>Japonese
Tea</em> is of a fainter Colour, and more
grateful Taste. Hence it also happens,
that the <em>Tchia</em> of the <em>Japonese</em>, is far more
esteemed than the <em>Thee</em> of the <em>Chinese</em>;
since one Pound of the former is frequently
sold at an Hundred <em>Libræ</em>; for it is in
these Parts of the World believed, that
nothing is more salutary and beneficial
than this Herb, whether for protracting
Life to extreme old Age, or for preventing
the Attacks of Diseases. It not
only renders the Body vigorous and active,
and prevents the Stone, to which none of
the Inhabitants are for this Reason subject,
but also removes Head-achs, Stuffings
of the Head, Inflammations, and
Distillations of the Eyes, a Difficulty of
Breathing, Weakness of the Stomach,
Gripes of the Intestines, and Weariness.
It also so effectually prevents Sleep, that
those who drink it at Night, can sit up,
without feeling the least Inclination to sleep:
for it is moderately heating, and by constricting
the Mouth of the Stomach, hinders
the Ascent of those Vapours which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
are necessary to procure Sleep; so that,
by its Means, nothing hinders or interrupts
those who intend to read or write all Night.</p>

<p>"This Plant, however, seems neither to
have been long known, nor long used,
among the <em>Chinese</em>, since they have no
hieroglyphical Characters, such as most of
their Letters are, which express its Nature
and Qualities. These two Nations also differ
widely, with respect to the Manner of using
<em>Tea</em>; since the <em>Japonese</em> mix the <em>Tea</em>,
powdered in a Marble Mortar, with warm
Water: Whereas, the <em>Chinese</em>, boil the
Plant itself with some Liquor, adding a
few Grains of Salt, or Sugar. This Decoction,
they drink with their Friends and
Visitors; and even their leading Men do
not think it beneath them, but rather a
Piece of Honour to prepare the <em>Tea</em> for
their Guests; for which Purpose they
have Closets in their Palaces, fitted up on
purpose, in which they keep their Pots,
Tripods, Tunnels, Cups, Spoons, and
other <em>Tea</em> Utensils, which they buy at an
exorbitant Price, preserve in Silk, and only
use when their best Friends visit them.
These, they esteem as much as we do
Adamants, Gems, and the most precious
Stones. See <cite>Joh. Maffæus</cite>, <cite>Rer. Indicar.

<p><cite>Nicolaus Trigautius</cite>, in <cite>Tractat. de Regno
Chinæ, Cap. 3.</cite> where he treats of the Things
produced in <em>China</em>, gives us the following
Particulars, with respect to <em>Tea</em>: "I purposely,
says he, omit the Description of
many Things necessary, such as Marbles
of different Colours, Carbuncles, and other
Stones and Gems, not unfit for painting;
odoriferous Woods, Bitumens, and an incredible
Number of other Curiosities;
but I neither can, nor ought to pass over,
in Silence, two or three Things, unknown
to the <em>Europeans</em>; the first of which is,
that Shrub, of the Leaves of which is
prepared that celebrated Liquor, called
<em>Cia</em>, by the <em>Chinese</em>, <em>Japonese</em>, and neighbouring
Countries. It is not possible, that
the Herb from which this is prepared has
been very long used by the <em>Chinese</em>; since,
in order to represent it, they have no
hieroglyphical Characters, such as all their
Letters are. Hence it may, perhaps, be
suspected, that our <em>European</em> Woods produce
this Herb. They gather the Leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
in the <em>Spring</em>, dry them in a Shade, and
keep them for preparing a Decoction,
which they almost continually use, not
only at their Meals, but also when their
Friends come to visit them; for this is generally
the Entertainment to which they invite
each other. It is always drank, or rather
sipped warm; nor is it ungrateful to the
Palate, in consequence of its temperate
Bitterness; but it is very salutary, and
frequently used for various Disorders. <em>Tea</em>
is not with them all of one Price; since,
sometimes, a Pound is sold for a Noble,
and, at other Times, for two or three, if
it is accounted good: The best of the
<em>Japonese Tea</em> is often sold for ten or twelve,
and the Method of preparing it with these,
is somewhat different from that of the
<em>Chinese</em>; for the <em>Japonese</em>, having reduced
their <em>Tea</em> to a Powder, mix two or three
Spoonfuls of it with a Cup of boiling
Water, which they drink when moderately
cool: Whereas, the <em>Chinese</em> throw some
of the Leaves into a Vessel of boiling
Water, which, after it has imbibed the
Force of the <em>Tea</em>, they drink, leaving the
Leaves." But, in the seventh Chapter of
the same Work, which treats of some of
the Customs of the <em>Chinese</em>, the Author speaks
in the following Manner: "When any one
receives a formal Invitation to a Feast;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the Day before, or several Days before, it
is to be kept, the Master sends him a Kind
of Ticket, desiring his Presence: When
he is come to the House, and the usual
Ceremonies past, he is set down in the first
Hall, where he drinks his <em>Tea</em>; after
which he is conducted to the Feasting-Room,
which is not adorned with Carpets,
which they never use, but with Pictures,
Flowers, Vessels, and other antient
Houshold Furniture." Though these
Accounts may satisfy the Vulgar, yet they
will not prove satisfactory to Physicians,
who want to know, whether <em>Tea</em> is an Herb,
a Shrub, or a Species of Copse; for the two
last quoted Authors differ from each other;
since <cite>Tulpius</cite> calls the <em>Chinese Tea</em>, "an
Herb, with darkish, green, oblong Leaves,
acuminated and crenated about the Edges,
with fibrous Roots, divided into many
small Shreds. Whereas, the Leaves of
the <em>Japonese Tea</em> are of a fainter green Colour,
and of a more grateful Taste." But
<cite>Trigautius</cite> affirms, "that it is a Shrub of
the Leaves, of which the celebrated <em>Cia</em>,
of the <em>Chinese</em> and <em>Japonese</em>, is prepared
by Decoction." The former asserts, that
the Herb <em>Tea</em>, grows not only in <em>China</em> and
<em>Japan</em>, but also in <em>Chiam</em>: The latter thinks
it is to be suspected, that it is also produced
in the <em>European</em> Woods: But, as I shall af<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>terwards
accurately discuss these Points, I
shall only here observe, from <cite>Olearius</cite>, that
<cite>Maff&oelig;us</cite>, in <cite>Tr. de Rebus Indicis</cite>, affirms,
that the <em>Japonese</em>, from a certain Plant, express
an highly salutary Liquor, which they
call <em>Chia</em>; and <cite>Linschotanus</cite>, in <cite>Tr. de Insula
Japoniæ</cite>, tells us, that the Inhabitants
of <em>Japan</em> prepare a Drink called <em>Chaa</em>, from
a certain Herb: But these Authors neither
mention the Shrub, nor the Leaves, but
unanimously assert <em>Tea</em> to be an Herb. <cite>Jacobus
Bontius</cite>, Physician in Ordinary to the
Town of <em>New Batavia</em>, in the Island of
<em>Java</em>, in the <em>East Indies</em>, in <cite>Medic. Indor.
Lib. 2. de Conserv. Valetud. Dialog. 6.</cite> affirms,
"that the Leaves of the small Herb,
from which <em>Tea</em> is prepared, resemble those
of the <em>Daisy</em> or lesser <em>Cousound</em>, and have
small Incisions about their Edges." But
since, in the subsequent Chapter, he affirms,
that the Inhabitants of that Country, though
brutally ignorant in every other Respect, have
yet such an exact Knowledge of Roots and
Plants, that if <em>Pavius</em>, the greatest Botanist
of his Age, was to rise from the Dead, he
would wonder to find that he could be instructed
by these Men; I am surprized, he
should have despised their Information, and,
contrary to the Custom of their Historiographers,
given us (<em>Europeans</em>) such a lame and
imperfect Description of <em>Tea</em>, when com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>menting
on the <em>Indian</em> Plants. One would
be ready to take it for an Herb, when he is
told, that its Leaves resemble those of the
<em>Daisy</em>, and have small Incisions about the
Edges, which <cite>Tulpius</cite> also ascribes to them.
It is worth our Observation, that <cite>Tulpius</cite>,
<cite>Trigautius</cite>, <cite>Bontius</cite>, and other Authors, unanimously
agree in this, that the Decoction of
<em>Tea</em> is of a pretty, grateful, bitter Taste. In
order, therefore, to clear up these Difficulties,
I must have recourse to the Reverend Father,
<cite>Alexander de Rhodes</cite>, who, in his <cite>Sommaire
des divers Voyages &amp; Missions Apostoliques</cite>,
speaks in the following Manner:
"Among the most memorable Things in
this Country, is <em>Tay</em>; the Use of which
is not only common to all the <em>Eastern</em>
Countries, but also begins to be known
in <em>Europe</em>: It is justly to be reckoned
among the most salutary Substances which
I observed in this Country; and I do not
know but it is one of the principal Causes,
why the Inhabitants not only enjoy
such a good State of Health, but also
arrive at so extreme an old Age. The
Leaves are as big as those of the Pomegranate
Tree, and the Shrub itself resembles
the Myrtle Bush. Nor does <em>Tea</em> grow in
any Part of the World, except in two
Provinces of <em>China</em>, which are <em>Nanquin</em>
and <em>Chim</em>, the Inhabitants of which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
their Harvests for <em>Tea</em> Leaves, as we have
for our Grain in <em>Europe</em>. These Leaves
they dry in Furnaces, and preserve for Use
in close stopped Vessels. It is frequently
used through all <em>China</em>, <em>Japan</em>, <em>Tonquin</em>,
and other Kingdoms; and there are such
great Quantities of it, that it is sold at a
Small Price. For this Reason they use it
frequently every Day, or rather each Hour,
prepared in the following Manner: They
throw the Leaves into boiling Water,
which they forthwith take off the Fire;
and when the Leaves have subsided, which
is generally in a Quarter of an Hour, they
drink the Water, from which they find
three very happy Effects; the first of
which is to repress Vapours, and alleviate
Pains of the Head: For when I laboured
under an <em>Hemicrania</em>, or any other Disorder
of the Head, by drinking this Water,
I had my Pain so quickly alleviated, as if
a Person had done it by the Application
of his Hand. When, for the Sake of
hearing Confessions, I was obliged to sit
up whole Nights, I used the same Remedy,
and, by its Means, was not only hindered
from sleeping, but also felt no more Uneasiness
next Day, than if I had not sat
up. I once made an Experiment of this
for six Nights successively, but must confess
I found myself wearied and exhausted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
The second Virtue of this Water, or Decoction,
is to corroborate the Stomach,
and the third to purge the Kidnies from
Stones and Gravel." <cite>Bernardus Varenius</cite>,
in <cite>Descript. Regni Japoniæ, Cap. 23.</cite>
speaks in the following Manner: "Not
only the <em>Japonese</em>, but also the <em>Chinese</em>,
are delighted with Draughts of almost
boiling Water, in which the Powder of
<em>Tea</em> is sprinkled. The Herb <em>Tea</em> is not
only Green itself, but also tinges any
Liquor with the same Colour. It grows
only in some, and not in all Countries,
and the finer Kind of its Leaves is
thought to be very valuable. These Leaves
are, by the richer Sort, kept in large Vessels,
close stopped, in order to prevent the
Access of the Air. The Leaves, before
they are used, are reduced to a Powder."
And a little after he subjoins, "This Liquor
is pleasant to the Taste, and highly salutary,
especially for carrying off the Uneasiness
produced by Surfeits, and for removing
all pituitous Disorders: So that
it is become a proverbial Saying, with respect
to the Rich, <cite>How is it possible they
should not enjoy good Health, since they
drink the best</cite> Tsia?" <cite>Olearius</cite>, in the
Work before quoted, speaks of <em>Tea</em> in the
following Manner: "We have already observed,
that at the <cite>Maidan</cite> in <em>Ispahan</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
there are, among others, particular Species
of Inns, called <em>Tzai</em>, <em>Chattai</em>, and <em>Chane</em>,
in which, as well as in other Places, the
<em>Persians</em> drink an hot, black Water, prepared
of an Herb, brought into their
Country by the <em>Usbeck Tartars</em>. This
Herb has oblong pointed Leaves, about
an Inch long, and half an Inch broad,
which, when dried, are of a blackish Colour,
and shrivel up into the Form of a
Worm; but they are the same with what
the <em>Chinese</em> call <em>Tea</em>, and the <em>Japonese</em> and
<em>Indians</em>, <em>Chia</em>, and <em>Cha</em>. In each of these
Nations, this Herb is highly esteemed;
the <em>Persians</em> boil it with Spring-Water,
<em>Anise</em> and <em>Fennel</em>: Some of them also add
a small Quantity of <em>Cloves</em> to it. The
<em>Persians</em>, <em>Chinese</em>, <em>Japonese</em>, and <em>Indians</em>,
ascribe uncommon Virtue and Efficacy to
this Water, affirming, that it produces the
most salutary Effects on the Stomach,
Lungs, Liver, Mass of Blood, and all
the <em>Viscera</em>, which it deterges and corroborates.
It also expels the Stone, removes
the Head-ach, and dissipates that superfluous
Humidity, which produces Lassitude
and Drowsiness. By drinking this
Water, a Person is rendered so lively, brisk,
and alert, as chearfully to bear the Want
of Sleep for several Nights, and without
any Pain, or Fatigue, apply long to Bu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>siness
of the greatest Importance. This
Liquor, when drank in Moderation, not
only preserves Health, but also protracts
Life to an excessive old Age. This Herb
<em>Tea</em> is, at present, well known in <em>Holland</em>,
since the <em>East-Indiamen</em> bring large Quantities
of it to <em>Amsterdam</em>." <cite>Johannes Albertus
von Mandelslo</cite>, in <cite>Itinerar. Indiæ Orientalis,
Cap. 11.</cite> gives us the following memorable
Account of <em>Tea</em>: "In our Visits,
we make use of the black Water, in which
the Herb <em>Tea</em> is boiled. This Liquor,
which is very common in the <em>Indies</em>, is
greatly admired, not only by the Natives,
but also by the <em>English</em> and <em>Dutch</em>; since
it is said to carry off Phlegm, warm the
Stomach, and procure Digestion. We
drink it three Times a Day, namely, in
the Morning, Afternoon, and Evening.
The <em>Persians</em> also drink a black Water,
called <em>Chavve</em>, which, in Colour, resembles
the <em>Tea</em>, though its Virtues and Efficacy
are different; since the <em>Chavve</em> is
a great Cooler, and procures Sterility, on
which Account, the lascivious <em>Persians</em>
chuse to drink it: On the contrary, the
<em>Tea</em> moderately warms, and strengthens,
the Bowels and Stomach."</p>

<p><cite>Gulielmus Leyl</cite>, a Native of <em>Denmark</em>,
after his Return from the <em>East Indies</em>, at my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Request, courteously wrote me the following
Particulars with respect to <em>Tea</em>: "I was
informed by the <em>Chinese</em>, in the Islands
of <em>Java</em>, <em>Macascar</em>, <em>Celebes</em>, and other
Places, that the <em>Cha</em>, or <em>Thee</em>, grew in
<em>China</em> and <em>Cathaya</em>; but that the best
came from <em>Cathaya</em>, a Country belonging
to the <em>Tartars</em>. The Herb is, in the
<em>Chinese</em>, <em>Japonese</em>, <em>Tartarian</em>, <em>Persian</em>,
<em>Arabic</em>, <em>Turkish</em>, and <em>Indostan</em> Languages,
called <em>Cha</em>; in the Pronunciation of which
Word, it is to be observed, that the <em>Ch</em> is
sounded as it is in <em>Spain</em> and <em>England</em>;
but is by the <em>Persians</em>, <em>Arabians</em>, and <em>Turks</em>,
expressed by one of their own Characters.
By such of the <em>Chinese</em> as border upon the
Sea it is called <em>The</em>. In these Countries,
vast Sums of Money are laid out upon this
Herb, which is said to be possessed of very
considerable Virtues; for it corroborates
the Stomach, and produces a good Digestion;
nourishes the Limbs, and dissipates
and carries off by Urine, or otherwise,
all peccant and redundant Humidity. It
also cures the Gout, and prevents, or expels
the Stone and Gravel. During my
Residence, for many Years there, I never
had the smallest Symptoms of the Gout,
with which I have been violently afflicted
since my Return into <em>Europe</em>. The <em>Chinese</em>
are also Strangers to the Stone, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
their <em>Tea</em> not only preserves the Body in
good Health, but also removes Intoxication.
It prevents Sleep, and renders
Persons alert and chearful in the Dispatch
of Business. The Water prepared of this
Herb, is to be drank in a Morning fasting,
with preserved Ginger, as also after
Dinner, between Meals, after Supper, or
at any Time, since the frequent Use of it
is not hurtful. They boil a Pint of Water
in a Pot, then put a Spoonful of
<em>Tea</em> into it, and cover it close up for a
Quarter of an Hour, during which Time
they shake it frequently. Those to whom
this Liquor is disagreeable, on account of
its bitter Taste, put Sugar-Candy into the
Cup; but, its Efficacy is greater, when
drank without it. The People of Fashion
in <em>China</em> and <em>Japan</em>, have their particular
Kettles, in which they boil the Water by
itself, and then pour it upon the <em>Tea</em> in
another Vessel, which they cover for a
Quarter of an Hour, shaking it frequently."</p>

<p>In order to determine that dubious and
perplexing Question, Whether the <em>Tea</em> of the
<em>Chinese</em> is an Herb, or a small Shrub? It is
necessary I should previously enquire, whether
it is only produced in <em>Asia</em>, or whether
any of it is also to be found in <em>Europe</em>; as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
also which of the <em>European</em> Plants is the most
proper Succedaneum to it? In these Disquisitions,
I must, therefore, have recourse to
the Suffrages of the before-quoted Authors.
But I must here advise all Physicians to divest
their Minds of Prejudice, and carefully peruse
<cite>Hippocrates</cite>'s Treatise <cite>de Aere, Aquis, &amp;
Locis</cite>, by which they will be informed, how
much <em>Airs</em>, <em>Waters</em>, and <em>Soils</em>, agree, or disagree,
and what proportionable Variations,
or Alterations, these Agreements, or Differences
are capable of producing. The celebrated
<cite>Hoffman</cite>, in <cite>Lib. 2. de Medicament.
Officinalibus, Cap. 15.</cite> when speaking of the
<em>Myrtle</em>, tells us, "That we are carefully to
attend to the native Soil and Climate of a
Plant, by which it is rendered either better
or worse, in consequence of which, its
Faculties and Virtues will not be the same in
different Countries." This Doctrine I have
everywhere inculcated in my <em>Quadripartitium</em>,
but especially in the Histories of <em>Betony</em>, <em>Carduus
Benedictus</em>, <em>Scurvy-Grass</em>, <em>Marsh Trefoil</em>,
<em>Dragons</em> and <em>Squills</em>. My Design in advancing
this is, to shew the Probability of the Production
of <em>Tea</em>, not only in the Kingdoms
of the <em>East Indies</em>, such as <em>China</em>, <em>Japan</em>,
<em>Chian</em>, <em>Nanquin</em>, and <em>Cham</em>; but also, according
to the Conjecture of <cite>Trigautius</cite>, in
the <em>European</em> Woods and Forests: And I
am the more inclined to this Opinion, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>cause
the celebrated <cite>Olearius</cite> informs us, that
the <em>Tartars</em> of <em>Uzbeck</em>, who, according to
<cite>De Laet. in Descript. Persiæ</cite>, <cite>Cap. 1.</cite> are
separated from the <em>Persians</em>, wage War
upon them, and export <em>Tea</em> from <em>Cattajo</em>
into <em>Persia</em>: Besides, <em>Gulielmus Leyl</em>, a Gentleman,
not only of Distinction, but also of
untainted Veracity, informs me, in his Letter,
that in <em>Java</em> the greater, <em>Macassar</em>, and
<em>Celibes</em>, he was told by the Inhabitants, that
<em>Cha</em> or <em>The</em> grows in <em>China</em> and <em>Catajo</em>; but
that the best is, by the <em>Tartars</em>, exported
from the latter of these Places, Now, it is
sufficiently known, that <em>Tartary</em>, on account
of the Elevation of the Pole, in many
Respects, agrees with the <em>European</em> Provinces,
situated under the same Degree of Elevation;
so that, it is by no means absurd to
assert that many Trees, Shrubs, and Herbs,
should thrive as well in these <em>Northern</em> Provinces,
as in <em>Tartary</em>, which, like them, is
diversified with Precipices, Forests, Mountains,
Pasture-Grounds, Vallies, and Rivers.
In a word, as <cite>Tulpius</cite> and <cite>Trigautius</cite> think
that neither <em>Tea</em>, nor its Use, were long
known to the <em>Chinese</em>, because they had neither
any antient Names for it, nor Hieroglyphics
to express its Nature; I am more and
more confirmed, that <em>Cha</em>, or <em>The</em>, grows
more plentifully in <em>Catajo</em> than in <em>China</em>
itself, especially since <cite>Olearius</cite> and <cite>Leyl</cite> in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>form
us, that <em>Cha</em> is a <em>Tartarian</em> Word; and,
according to the latter of these Authors, only
some of the <em>Chinese</em>, who live upon the Shore,
have begun to call <em>Cha</em>, <em>Te</em>. Since, therefore,
the <em>Europeans</em> frequent <em>China</em>, or its adjacent
Islands, much more than they do <em>Tartary</em>,
and since the <em>Chinese</em> call the <em>Cha</em> of the
<em>Tartars</em> <em>The</em>, it is probable, that this is the
Original of the Word <em>Tea</em> in <em>Europe</em>, But it
is to be observed, that <cite>Tulpius</cite> asserts, that,
the <em>Tchia</em> of the <em>Japonese</em>, is far more valuable
than the <em>Thee</em> of the <em>Chinese</em>; since a
Pound of the former is sometimes sold at
an Hundred <em>Libræ</em> of Silver, which, if I
am not mistaken, amount to forty Crowns.
But <cite>Trigautius</cite> affirms, that a Pound of the
<em>Chinese</em> is sold at one <em>Noble</em>, and at most for
two or three; whereas, a Pound of the best
<em>Japonese</em> is often sold at ten or twelve. Father
<cite>Rhodius</cite> tells us, that <em>Tea</em> is no where
produced, except in two Provinces of <em>China</em>,
<em>Nanquin</em> and <em>Chim</em>; and immediately subjoins,
That there was such Plenty of it, that
it sold at a very low Rate: Though these
Accounts are inconsistent with each other,
yet it is none of my Business to reconcile
them; since my Design is only to shew, that
the <em>Cha</em>, the <em>Tchia</em>, or <em>Thee</em>, whether a Species
of Copse, or an Herb, is indigenous to
<em>Tartary</em>. Now, as <cite>Tulpius</cite> and <cite>Trigautius</cite>
have shewn, that <em>Tea</em> has not been long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
known to the <em>Chinese</em>; and, as <cite>Olearius</cite> and
<cite>Leyl</cite> assert, that it is exported from <em>Tartary</em>
into <em>Persia</em>, as well as <em>China</em>, I am of
Opinion, that it probably began to be known
in <em>China</em> when the <em>Tartars</em> in 1644 made an
Incursion into that Country, and that it was
first transported into <em>Europe</em> from the <em>East-Indies</em>.
And though the Authors mentioned
by <cite>Olearius</cite> affirm, that the <em>Thee</em> of the <em>Chinese</em>
was known before this Incursion; yet as
the <em>Tartars</em> had several Times before laid
<em>China</em> waste, it is not improbable, but the
<em>Chinese</em> were, by the <em>Tartars</em>, with whom I
believe it is cheap, first taught the Use of <em>Tea</em>,
as we were by the <em>Chinese</em>: For if, according
to <cite>Tulpius</cite>, <em>Tea</em> is sold at so great a Rate
in <em>China</em>, or, if a Pound of the best <em>Tea</em> is
often sold at twelve <em>Nobles</em> in <em>Japan</em>, I cannot
see how the Merchants of <em>Amsterdam</em>
and <em>Hamburg</em>, who may reasonably be allowed
a fourth of Profit, could afford a Pound
for eight <em>Nobles</em>. Since, therefore, <em>Tartary</em>
is a very extensive Kingdom; and since, in
some Provinces of it, the <em>Tea</em> of the <em>Chinese</em>
grows, I think it very probable, that the same
<em>Tea</em> may be found in the similar, heathy,
copsy, and uncultivated Places of <em>Europe</em>.
We now come to enquire, whether <em>Tea</em> is an
Herb, or a Kind of Copse: Besides the Authors,
therefore, already quoted from <cite>Olearius</cite>,
as affirming that it is an Herb, <cite>Bon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>tius</cite>,
<cite>Varenius</cite>, <cite>Olearius</cite>, <cite>Johannes Albertus
von Mandelslo</cite>, and <cite>Leyl</cite>, also call it an Herb:
But <cite>Trigautius</cite> and <cite>Rhodius</cite> pronounce it a
Kind of Copse, or small Shrub. If, therefore,
we are swayed in our Judgment by the
Plurality of Voices, we must infallibly conclude
<em>Tea</em> to be an Herb. But as, in all Cases,
one Eye-Witness is better than ten who
take Things upon Report; and as the two
last-mentioned Authors travelled through the
<em>East-Indies</em>, it is more reasonable to trust to
their Descriptions, than to those of the others,
who, being no professed Botanists, were, in
some measure, misled by botanical Authors,
who too often confound Words, as we have
shewn in the Dissertation on <em>Tobacco</em>: However,
to reconcile these Differences, we say,
that <em>Tea</em> may be defined and described, either
as an Herb, or as a Kind of Copse, or small
Shrub; for as Geographers, in their Descriptions
of <em>Nova Zembla</em>, and the <em>Terra
Australis incognita</em>, make Conjectures about
some Things which they never saw, because
they were never there; so, why may not I,
though I never was in <em>Asia</em>, make an Attempt
to delineate an <em>Asiatic</em> Plant, which is
the Herb, or Shrub, <em>Tea</em>, in order to prevent
that excessive Import of it, which corrupts
our Regimen, and impairs our Health no
less than the <em>Tobacco</em> sent us from <em>America</em>?
Now, though <em>Asia</em> furnishes the <em>Chinese</em> with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
<em>Tea</em>, as a salutary Medicine, yet she obtrudes
it upon us, at the same Time we are ignorant
what it is; for which Reason I shall describe
<em>Tea</em>, both as an Herb, and as a Kind of
Copse, or small Shrub. "<em>Tea</em>, therefore, as
an Herb, has oblong Leaves, acuminated,
crenated about the Edges, and about an
Inch long, and half an Inch broad. In
<em>China</em> these Leaves are of a dark green
Colour, and of a bitter Taste; whereas
those produced in <em>Japan</em>, are of a fainter
Green, and more grateful Taste, tinging
any Liquor with the same Colour.
These Leaves, when dried, become black,
and shrivelled up, like small Worms, and
the Herb has a fibrous Root, divided into
many small Shreds." If any should tell me,
that this seems to be a Description of <em>Betony</em>,
I answer, so it is; and I would rather
perswade the <em>Europeans</em> to use this Herb,
possessed of numberless known Virtues, than
to persist in the Use of the unknown <em>Tea</em> of
the <em>Chinese</em>, purchased at a great Expence,
and calculated for impoverishing Families.
It is indeed certain, that, as the moderate Use
of it, without producing a preter-natural Heat,
conforts and dries the Brain, and whole nervous
System, so the immoderate Use of it,
cannot fail to be equally noxious to the <em>Europeans</em>
as the Abuse of <em>Wine</em>. <em>Tea</em>, as a Kind
of Copse, or small Shrub, may be described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
in the following Manner: "<em>Tea</em> is a small
Shrub, greatly resembling the <em>Myrtle</em>-Bush,
with dark green Leaves, as large as
those of the <em>Pomegranate</em>, but with small
Incisions about the Edges, like those observable
in the Leaves of the <em>Daisy</em>. These
Leaves are carefully collected in the <em>Spring</em>,
dried in a Shade, or in proper Furnaces,
and preserved in pretty large Vessels, close
stopped, in order to prevent the free Access
of the Air." If any one should find
fault with me for describing <em>Tea</em>, both as
an Herb, and as a Kind of Copse, or small
Shrub; I can vindicate myself, by desiring
him to compare each of these Descriptions
with the different Accounts given by all the
before-cited Authors, whose Veracity cannot
be called in Question. But, perhaps, it may
be objected, that <cite>Bontius</cite> asserts, that <em>Tea</em> is
an Herb, and describes it as such, and consequently,
that I corrupt what I intended
to correct, which happened to <cite>Epicurus</cite>, attempting
to rectify the Doctrines of <cite>Democritus</cite>:
I answer, that <cite>Bontius</cite>, through an
Affectation of laconic Brevity, darkened his
Description of <em>Tea</em>, by comparing its Leaves,
which are crenated, to those of the <em>Daisy</em>,
which have small Incisions: Whereas, he
might, with more Justice, have compared
them to the Leaves of any Shrub, or Copse:
But the Reader will, possibly, condemn me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
for <em>Pyrrhonism</em>, or <em>Scepticism</em>, and upbraid
me with treating of Things, without coming
to any fixed and final Conclusion. But,
in answer to this Charge, I affirm, in the
Words of <cite>Vossius de Sect. Philosoph. Cap.</cite> 20.
"That <em>Scepticism</em> is not absolutely to be
condemned; since, though many Things
are certain, yet far more are uncertain;
and these latter combined and interwoven
with the former, impose on the Mind
by their Similitude to Truth; so that it
is necessary to use all Diligence in distinguishing
Truth from Error." <cite>Cicero</cite>, in
<cite>Lib. 1. de Natur. Deor.</cite> professes himself of
the same Opinion: "I am none of those,
<em>says he</em>, to whom nothing appears true;
but I affirm, that Truth and Falshood are
sometimes so intimately mixed, and bear
so near a Resemblance to each other, that
there is hardly any Criterion for distinguishing
them." But, leaving all dubious
Ratiocinations, we shall now declare our
Sentiments in an explicit Manner, and come
to a fixed and determinate Conclusion. For
this Purpose, let us compare the Descriptions
which <cite>Dodonæus</cite> gives us of the Herb <em>Betony</em>,
and of the Shrub <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, with
those two I have given of the <em>Chinese Tea</em>:
I am then intirely free from Partiality, when
I think that the Properties ascribed to these
two, especially to the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
agree to the <em>Chinese Tea</em>; nor, considering
how far I am advanced in Years, do I care
how much I may be ridiculed for maintaining
such an Opinion, since I have long ago
formed my Mind upon those noble and exalted
Sentiments, which <cite>Epictetus</cite>, in <cite>Enchirid.
Cap. 29.</cite> expresses in the following
beautiful Manner: "If thou inclinest to
commence the Study of Wisdom and Virtue,
thou must forthwith prepare thyself
for future Reproach and Contempt, since
many will hiss thee, upbraid thee with becoming
a Philosopher all on a sudden, and
sneeringly ask the Reason of thy supercilious
Air: Do thou, in the mean time,
guard against a supercilious Behaviour, as
much as thou possibly canst; but, like a
faithful Centinel, placed in a particular
Post by thy Master, rigidly maintain and
adhere to those Things which, to thee,
appear best and most praise-worthy; and,
for thy Comfort, remember this, that if
thou resolutely keepest thy Post, thou wilt,
at last, become the Admiration of those
who before derided thee: Whereas, if
thou shamefully quittest thy Station, and
succumbest to the heedless and unthinking
Herd, thou wilt be doubly derided."
But, as moral Reflections may be thought
impertinent on such Occasions, we shall return
to our Subject. <cite>Dodonæus</cite>, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
in <cite>Pemptad. 1. Lib. 2. Cap. 20.</cite> tells us,
"that <em>Betony</em> has oblong, broad, and green
Leaves, somewhat rough, serrated about
the Edges, and resembling those of the
Oak, though somewhat smaller." Now,
<cite>Tulpius</cite> informs us, that the Leaves of <em>Tea</em>
are oblong, acuminated and serrated about
the Edges: And <cite>Olearius</cite> affirms, that they
are about an Inch in Length, and half an
Inch in Breadth. <cite>Tulpius</cite> also asserts, that in
<em>China</em>, they are of a dark green Colour;
whereas, in <em>Japan</em>, they are of a fainter Colour;
so that these Descriptions quadrate very
exactly with <em>Betony</em>. The <em>Chamelæagnus</em> is,
by <cite>Dodonæus</cite>, in <cite>Stirp. Histor. Pemptad. 6.
Cap. 20.</cite> described in the following Manner:
"The <em>Chamelæagnus</em> is a small and
low Shrub, rarely rising to the Height of a
Cubit: It sends forth some Branches, which
bear small, broad, and oblong Leaves, not
unlike those of the <em>Myrtle</em>, but harder, and
frequently longer: All the Parts of the
Shrub, and especially its Seeds, are somewhat
odorous: It delights in wild and
uncultivated Soils, which are somewhat
marshy and aqueous." The Authors before
quoted, have made no Mention, either
of the Seeds, or Flowers; nor, though I have
had an Opportunity of turning over large
Quantities of <em>Tea</em>, have I ever found any
Part of a Flower, Stem, Apex, Calyx, Down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Seed, Pods of Seed, Berries, or any Thing
analogous to any of these, except some few
Pieces, of a Kind of arundinacious Grass;
from which we may justly infer, that the
<em>Chinese Tea</em> delights in uncultivated, aqueous,
and marshy Soils, as well as the <em>European
Chamelæagnus</em>; which, as described by <cite>Dodonæus</cite>,
exactly resembles the <em>Tea</em> of the <em>Chinese</em>.
The Reasons why I have compared
<em>Tea</em> to <em>Betony</em>, are sufficiently obvious; since
my Accounts of the former, taken from <cite>Trigautius</cite>,
<cite>Rhodius</cite>, and <cite>Bontius</cite>, exactly agree
to the latter; for <cite>Trigautius</cite> affirms, that the
Leaves called <em>Tea</em>, when gathered from a
certain Shrub, and boiled in Water, afford
that celebrated Liquor, so much used by the
<em>Chinese</em>, <em>Japonese</em>, and their neighbouring
Nations: And <cite>Rhodius</cite> asserts, that the Leaves
of <em>Tea</em> are, in a great measure, like those of
the <em>Myrtle</em>, and, in Bulk, equal to those of
the <em>Pomegranate</em>. I have, in a particular
Manner, mentioned the Crenations of the
Leaves, because no such Circumstance is specified,
either by <cite>Dodonæus</cite>, in his Description
of the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, or by <cite>Trigautius</cite> and
<cite>Rhodius</cite>, in their Accounts of the Leaves of
<em>Tea</em>, which, according to <cite>Olearius</cite>, are about
an Inch long, half an Inch broad, and, when
dried, assume a blackish Colour, all which
Circumstances hold true of the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>.
<cite>Tulpius</cite> informs us, that the Leaves of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
<em>Tea</em> are of a dark green Colour, oblong,
acuminated, and crenated about the Edges;
and <cite>Bontius</cite> describes them with small Incisions
about the Edges, like those of the <em>Daisy</em>:
Besides, if the Reader compares what <cite>Dodonæus</cite>
advances, with respect to the native Soil
of the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, with the Description
I have given of it, he will find it probable that
it is also produced in <em>Tartary</em>; so that we
have just Reason to conclude, that the <em>Cha</em>
of the <em>Tartars</em>, and <em>Thee</em> of the <em>Chinese</em>, are
nothing else but the <em>European Chamelæagnus</em>.
Another Analogy is also to be observed between
the Leaves of <em>Tea</em>, and those of the
<em>Chamelæagnus</em>, which is, that only the larger
Leaves of each of them are crenated. If
it should be objected, that <cite>Dodonæus</cite> inclined
to insinuate, that the Leaves of the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>
are like those of the <em>Myrtle</em>; and
that the Leaves of the true <em>Myrtle</em> are not
crenated: I answer, that I am sufficiently
apprised of this; but, at the same time,
would have the Objector remember, that
<cite>Caspar Bauhine</cite> finds some Things wanting
in the Figure of the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, exhibited
in the <em>Latin</em> Edition of <cite>Dodonæus</cite>, and
for that Reason, prefers the Figure in the
<em>Dutch</em> Edition to it. His Description is also
very defective, since he neither mentions the
Crenation of the Leaves, nor the Sporting
of Nature, which are very material Points;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
since the Leaves are not all crenated in the same
Manner, and sometimes not crenated at all,
especially at the Points, till they have arrived
at a certain Age and Bulk. Similar Sportings
of Nature are frequently to be observed;
since, in one and the same Mallow, it often
happens, that one Leaf is not like another.
There is also a surprizing Variety, both in
the Form and Number of the Leaves of the
<cite>Eupatorium Canadense Foliis Enulæ Jacobi
Cornuti</cite> of the <cite>Lysimachia Lutea Major</cite> and
<cite>Minor</cite>, and of the <cite>Pseudolysimachia</cite>. It is
also sufficiently known, that the <em>Peruvian</em>
Flower in <em>Europe</em>, varies every Day considerably
from the same Flower in <em>Peru</em>; but
we are not, for this Reason, to deny that
they both belong to the same Species. Thus,
though in <em>Europe</em>, there is a Kind of Sporting
of Nature in the Leaves of the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>;
yet all these Leaves, when most accurately
compared with the <em>Tartarian</em> or
<em>Chinese Tea</em>, are only found to differ inconsiderably
from them in Size, Colour, and
Crenations: So that we may conclude, that
the Shrub <em>Chamelæagnus</em> belongs to the same
Species with the <em>Tea</em> of the <em>Tartars</em> and
<em>Chinese</em>: But, lest my own Authority should
be questioned, I shall, from that of other
Botanists, prove this surprizing Variation in
our own <em>Chamelæagnus</em>. I am indeed sorry
that the <em>Chamelæagnus</em> is not sufficiently and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
fully treated of, either in the last Edition
of <cite>Tabernemontanus</cite>, or in the <cite>Ebrodunense
Herbarium</cite>. But we must supply this Defect
from <cite>Bauhine</cite>, who, in <cite>Pinax. 40. Lib.
11. Sect. 4.</cite> tells us, "That the <em>Rhus Myrtifolia
Belgica</em>, or <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, has its
Leaves sometimes broad, and sometimes
narrow; and I have been told by Dr.
<cite>Backmaster</cite>, that its Leaves are sometimes
crenated like those of a Shrub; such as
the <em>Rosemary</em> of the <em>Northern</em> Nations, or
our own <em>Myrtle</em>." In 1622, when walking
in a Copsy Field, near <em>Rostock</em>, I broke
off a small Twig of this <em>Chamelæagnus</em> in
the <em>Spring</em>, before it was in the Flower.
This I carefully preserved till it was fully
dry, and found the Leaves exactly to resemble
those of the <em>Chinese Tea</em>, in Tenderness,
Size, Colour, and Crenations. But that this
Affinity and Resemblance might be still farther
evinced, I have, in <cite>Quadripartit. Botan.</cite>
given a Cut of one of the tender Leaves of
the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, gathered in the <em>Spring</em>,
and another of a full grown Leaf, gathered
in the <em>Summer</em>; and to these I have added
two Cuts of <em>Tea</em> Leaves, produced in <em>China</em>:
But, some may object, that the <em>Chinese Tea</em>
differs from the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, because, according
to <cite>Rhodius</cite>, the Leaves of the former
appear in the Beginning of the <em>Spring</em> at
<em>Nanquin</em> and <em>Chim</em>; and, when dried, are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
far from resembling Leaves, that they rather
seem to be small Buds or Gems of Shrubs, or
Trees: Whereas, the Branches of our <em>Chamelæagnus</em>
are not cut, till the Middle, or
latter End of the <em>Summer</em>, and are negligently
hung up in the Shops, with the Leaves, Seeds,
and Flowers. These Circumstances, I confess,
must produce a considerable Difference
in these Leaves, not only with respect to Colour
and Smell, but also, perhaps, with respect
to Qualities and Virtues. If I should
be asked, whether it is expedient to recommend
the <em>Chamelæagnus</em> as a Succedaneum,
to the <em>Chinese Tea</em>? I answer, it is highly
expedient. If it should be said, that it affects
the Head; I reply, so does <em>Betony</em>, which
procures a certain Hilarity, or Agility, to the
Brain and Members, by which Means, it
greatly invigorates the Animal Faculty: For
this specific Quality of <em>Tea</em>, it is so much used
by Statesmen, in order to render them brisk
and active, for the Discharge of their Offices:
For this Class of Men, as well as Physicians,
are allowed Angular and uncommon Indulgences
by <cite>Plato</cite>, in <cite>Lib. 3. de Republica</cite>.
"The Gods, <em>says he</em>, can obtain no good
End by lying to Mortals; but, a Lie may
be useful to sick Persons; for which Reason
Lying is pardonable in Physicians, immediately
employed in their Business, but
not at all in Persons of a private Cha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>racter.
In Governors also, Lying is pardonable,
when it has a Tendency, either
to promote the Good of their Subjects, or
frustrate the Designs of their Enemies."
Some affirm, that Ale, prepared with the
<em>Chamelæagnus</em>, excites violent Head-achs,
from which they infer, that its Sulphur is
injurious to the Head: But I would have such
Persons remember, that the best Things may
be used to Excess. Thus a Pain is immediately
produced in the Head, by the Abuse
of the Wine of the <em>Rubus Idæus</em>, or that in
which the <em>Pimpinella Sanguisorba</em> has been
macerated. Hence, if you mix but a small
Quantity of the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, full of its Seeds,
with Ale, such Ale will speedily intoxicate
those who drink it; but if you put only a
few of the Leaves to the Ale, it will revive
the Spirits as effectually as the <em>Asiatic Tea</em>.
At the <em>Hague</em>, <em>Sinapi</em> is called <em>Senney</em>, and in
the <em>Netherlands</em>, <em>Mustard</em>; but this Change
of Names does not hinder <em>Sinapi</em> from being
an Herb of the same Species in these different
Parts. In <em>Europe</em> we are to have a due Regard
to the most commodious Time of
gathering the Leaves of the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>,
which, in <em>Asia</em>, is the <em>Spring</em>, and after they
are gathered, we are carefully to keep them
in large, close-stopped Vessels. Besides, we
are to consider, that the Climates of <em>Asia</em>
and <em>Europe</em> differ very widely; though I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
have shewn, that from the same Elevation of
the Pole, some <em>Northern</em> Countries have a
Climate, not much unlike to that of the
<em>Tartars</em>. But some may say, granting that
the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, or <em>Myrtus Nostras Sylvestris</em>,
is really the <em>Cha</em> of the <em>Tartars</em>, and
the <em>The</em> of the <em>Chinese</em> and <em>Persians</em>; yet it
never arrives at such Perfection in any Part
of <em>Europe</em>, as in <em>Tartary</em> or <em>China</em>: This,
perhaps, I may grant, with respect to <em>China</em>,
but not with respect to <em>Tartary</em>, for the Reasons
before specified, and on account of the
Climate, which, it is to be suspected, produces
<em>Tea</em> of little or no Value; for it is not
so much as mentioned in the following Account
of the <em>Tartars</em>, and their Herbs, given
by <cite>Antonius Maginus</cite>, in <cite>Comment. Nov. Geograph</cite>.
"The <em>Tartars</em> live in a most sordid,
nasty Manner; since only a very few of
them use Table-Cloths and Napkins at
their Meals: They drink Water, Milk,
and Ale prepared of Millet. Very little
Wine is produced in their Country; and
with that which is imported they intoxicate
themselves, which is with them considered
as an honourable and glorious Thing.
They commend the Juice or Milk of Sorrel,
because it corroborates the Stomach,
and proves purgative at the same Time.
They chearfully eat various Herbs, especially
such as grow near the <em>Tanais</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
among which they greatly extol an Herb
called <em>Baltracan</em>, which greatly nourishes
them, and restores their Strength. At the
Season, therefore, when this Herb bears
Fruit, the <em>Tartars</em> freely wander through
these Desarts, in which no other Kind of
Food or Aliment is to be found; for, if
they can provide nothing else, this Herb,
which they frequently find, and carry
home on Carts and Horses, proves sufficient
for their Sustenance." But I shall
proceed to contemplate our <em>Chamelæagnus</em>,
with greater Accuracy. It is, therefore, certain,
that <em>Iceland</em>, a cold and harsh Climate,
produces the best <em>Angelica</em> in all <em>Europe</em>; and
<em>Norway</em>, which is somewhat milder, though
intolerably cold in the <em>Winter</em>, yet affords
those large Quantities of <em>Gentian</em>, and other
medicinal Herbs, which the Traders in <em>Germany</em>
and <em>Holland</em> have annual Occasion for.
It is therefore probable, that our <em>Chamelæagnus</em>
may also be possessed of very singular
medicinal Virtues; and, that it is so, we shall
afterwards fully demonstrate. If it should
be objected, that the <em>Chinese</em> and <em>Tartarian
Teas</em> have become famous, but not the <em>European
Chamelæagnus</em>; I answer, that the
Objection has no Foundation in Reason; because
the Qualities and Temperaments of
Medicines are not altered by the Time at
which they began to be in Repute: Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the <em>Angelica</em> of <em>Iceland</em>, and the <em>Norvegian
Gentian</em> are celebrated in <em>Europe</em>; and tho'
it is not to be doubted, but <em>Tartary</em>, and
other Countries, lying under the same Elevation
of the Pole, produce <em>Angelica</em> and
<em>Gentian</em> equally good, yet these Medicines
are not there celebrated, because the Inhabitants
have not ventured upon the Use of
them. Thus, the perfumed Gloves sent us
from <em>Greece</em>, are more esteemed than those
smelling of <em>Amber</em>, <em>Musk</em>, <em>Stacte</em>, and <em>Cassia</em>,
sent us from <em>Italy</em>, and <em>Spain</em>, only because
they were famed before these latter
Countries began to use such a Practice; such,
and so great, is the Tyranny of Opinion,
and the Force of Custom! It is, therefore,
merely an ill-grounded Opinion, to believe
that our <em>Chamelæagnus</em> is inferior in Virtues
to the <em>Chinese</em> or <em>Tartarian Tea</em>; or that it is
to be neglected, and not introduced into the
Shops. Nor is it reasonable to infer, that it
is not the <em>Chinese Tea</em>, because it has never
been prepared in their Manner; or that it
ought not to be substituted in its stead, because
it has hitherto been little known, and
only used by a few instead of Hops. Tho'
I am always willing to yield to superior and
more powerful Reasons, yet I cannot help
thinking, that our <em>Chamelæagnus</em> may be very
commodiously substituted to the <em>Chinese Tea</em>.
Thus the <em>Scordium</em> of <em>Crete</em> is generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
thought the best of all others, for no other
Reason, but that it grows there. The <em>Germans</em>
and <em>Danes</em>, however, ceased to import
it from <em>Crete</em> and <em>Venice</em>, after they discovered
the true <em>Scordium</em>, and found large
Quantities of it produced in <em>Lapland</em>, which
also yielded great Plenty, not inferior to that
of <em>Asia</em>; so that we despise the <em>Asiatic</em>, in
comparison of our own. Thus, also, when
we found from Experience, that the Qualities
of our common <em>Wormwood</em>, were not inferior
to those of the <em>Wormwood</em> brought
from <em>Pontus</em> and <em>Rome</em>, we ceased to bring it
from these Places, and wisely used our own.
<cite>Hoffman</cite>, in <cite>Lib. 2. de Med. Offic.</cite> §. 5. tells
us, "That these <em>European</em> Mountains which
are most exposed to a free Air, produce
the wild or common <em>Wormwood</em>;
whereas, those of the <em>Pontic</em> and <em>Roman</em>
Kinds, are only to be found in Gardens."
But how opposite is our Conduct with respect
to <em>Tea</em>, which, at great Expence and Trouble,
we bring from <em>Asia</em>, when large Quantities
of it are produced in <em>Europe</em>? It is certainly
unaccountable, and an unpardonable Folly, for
a Man, who is rich at Home, to go Abroad
and beg: Now, we are equally foolish, for
despising that Plenty we have at Home, and
purchasing, at a great Price, the <em>Chinese Tea</em>,
when its Virtues are almost destroyed, as I
shall afterwards demonstrate. Some Persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
may, perhaps, reject my Sentiments, unless
they found an exact Agreement between the
Decoctions of <em>Chinese</em> and <em>Tartarian Tea</em>, and
the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, in Colour, Taste, Smell,
and other Qualities; and I doubt not in the
least, but they would find this Agreement,
provided our <em>Chamelæagnus</em> was gathered at
a proper Season, treated in the same Manner
with the <em>Chinese Tea</em>, and prepared in the
Method used by them. I would have tried
Experiments of this Kind, had not I wrote
this Treatise in the <em>Winter</em> Season; but I
thought a Delay of its Publication might be
attended with bad Consequences; since all
<em>Europe</em> has large Sums of Money annually
drained from it by the <em>Asiatic Tea</em>, I therefore
obtest, not only all Physicians, but also
others, fairly to examine, whether my Sentiments
and Reasonings on this Particular are
true, or only probable; for most Truths, according
to <cite>Cicero</cite>, have the Disadvantage to
be blended with Falshood and Error. But
some Persons may say I advance many
Things without establishing any. I own it
is so; for I am like the Images of <em>Mercury</em>
set up by the Highways of the Antients,
which pointed out the Road to others, without
ever entering it themselves. Perhaps
practical Physicians may blame me for making
the <em>Chamelæagnus</em> a Succedaneum for
the <em>Chinese Tea</em>; since it is sufficiently known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
that the former greatly affects the Head. I
own, indeed, I am subject to Error and Mistake,
as well as other Mortals: But I would
have these Physicians consider, that <cite>Trigautius</cite>
and <cite>Rhodius</cite> affirm, that the Leaves of
<em>Tea</em> resemble those of the <em>Myrtle</em>. Now,
the Leaves of the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, when arrived
at their full Growth in the <em>Summer</em>, are
so like those of the <em>Myrtle</em>, except that
these last are crenated at the Points, that the
one cannot be distinguished from the other.
They also produce an Effect similar to those
of the <em>Myrtle</em>; we must therefore compare
the <em>Chinese Tea</em>, the true <em>Myrtle</em>, and the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>,
with one another, in order, from
this Comparison, to ascertain and determine
the Virtues and Faculties of the Leaves of
each of them. The Virtues and Faculties,
then, of <em>Tea</em>, according to <cite>Tulpius</cite>, are these
following: "It renders the Body vigorous,
and removes nephritic Pains, to which
none of the <em>Chinese</em> are, for this very Reason,
obnoxious. It carries off Pains and
Stuffings of the Head, Inflammations of
the Eyes, Defluxions, Difficulty of Breathing,
Weakness of the Stomach, Gripings
of the Intestines, and Weariness: It also
prevents Sleep, heats moderately, and by
constricting the Mouth of the Stomach,
hinders the Vapours from ascending to the
Head. This Liquor, when drank warm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
<cite>Trigautius</cite> thinks highly salutary in a great
many Cases." Though I do not deny
these Things, yet, when the <em>Chinese</em> assert,
that nothing is more conducive to the protracting
of Life to an extreme old Age than
<em>Tea</em>, they run into an Hyperbole, no less glaring
and ostentatious than that of <cite>Cicero</cite>, when describing
his own Return, in <cite>L. Calphurn. Pis.</cite>
"<em>Rome</em> herself, <em>says he</em>, seemed to move
from her Foundation, in order to contemplate
her returning Guardian and Preserver,
whom she received with such unbounded
and universal Joy, that even the
Walls and Temples of the City seemed to
rejoice." This Happiness of the <em>Chinese</em>, is
intirely owing to other Causes; for their Air is
clement, and their Regimen so temperate, as,
almost, to come up to that of the <em>Pythagoreans</em>;
though the <em>Tartars</em> cannot boast
either of such a Climate, or such Moderation.
But, with the <em>Europeans</em>, a fuller and more
copious Diet is used, which is therefore productive
of more Diseases: Hence, the incomparable
<cite>Bartholine</cite>, in <cite>Consil. Med. de
Cometa.</cite> gives the <em>Europeans</em> a most salutary
Advice, by recommending a spare and slender
Diet, and condemning a full and copious
Regimen: "Moderate eating of Flesh, <em>says
he</em>, is to be injoined; since Excess, in this
Respect, is the Origin of violent Putrefaction,
and various Disorders. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
<cite>Diogenes apud Porphyr. in Lib. I. de Abstinen.</cite>
used to say, that those who eat
much were generally Thieves, and Soldiers;
and such as eat Flesh were Sycophants and
Tale-Bearers. Hence the <cite>Quadragesimal</cite>
Fast, in <cite>Concil. Laodicen. Canon. 50.</cite> is ordered
to be kept with Bread, Salt, and
Water, as <cite>Christoph. Justellus</cite> explains
the Word Ξηροφαγία from <cite>Epiphanius</cite>:"
Hence the eating little Flesh, but somewhat
more Broth, is conducive to the Preservation
of Health: So that the slender, spare Diet of
the <em>Asiatics</em> protracts their Lives to extreme
old Age; whereas, the full and luxurious
Regimen of the <em>Europeans</em>, cuts them off,
before the natural Period of their Life is expired:
So happy a Tendency have a clement
Air, and a proper Regimen, if not to protract
Life, yet, at least, to preserve Health,
and prevent Diseases. Not only <em>Tea</em>, which
we have from the <em>East</em>, but also <em>Chocolate</em>,
which is imported from the <em>West Indies</em>, begins
to be famous: With respect to this
latter Commodity, the Reader may consult
<cite>Antonius Colmerus de Ledesma</cite>, whose Work
is translated from <em>Spanish</em> into <em>Latin</em>, by
<cite>Marcus Aurelius Severinus</cite>. But I proceed in
the History of <em>Tea</em>, which is possessed of admirable
Qualities; since, according to <cite>Rhodius</cite>,
"It relieves the Head, prevents Vapours,
and is a Specific against the <em>Hemi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>crania</em>;
since, when he was afflicted with
this, or any other Disorder of the Head, he
was, by drinking <em>Tea</em>, immediately relieved.
It also prevents Sleep, corroborates
the Stomach, purges the Kidnies from
Stones and Gravel; and, according to <cite>Varenius</cite>,
is of singular Efficacy in removing
the Uneasiness arising from previous Surfeits,
and all pituitous Disorders." <cite>Olearius</cite>
also affirms, that it is possessed of constrictive
and astringent Quality, and is highly
salutary to the Stomach, Lungs, Liver,
Blood, and all the human <em>Viscera</em>, which it
deterges and corroborates; that it expels the
Stone, removes Head-achs, and dries up all
superfluous and redundant Homours, which
occasion Laziness and Drowsiness. <cite>Johannes
Albertus von Mandelslo</cite> informs us, that
the Water impregnated with <em>Tea</em>, is not only
much admired by the <em>Indians</em>, but also
highly esteemed by the <em>Dutch</em>, who frequently
use it for evacuating Phlegm, corroborating
the Stomach, heating and strengthening
all the <em>Viscera</em>; and that he was convinced,
that by drinking three Times a-day,
large Quantities of <em>Tea</em>, which is of an astringent
Quality, he was freed from a violent
Uneasiness and <em>Diarrh&oelig;a</em> at <em>Surat</em>. <cite>Gulielmus
Leyl</cite> asserts, that it corroborates the
Stomach, and assists its concoctive Powers,
heats the Members, and removes all excre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>mentitious
Humours, which it expels by
Urine, or in some other Manner; that it
removes the Gravel and Gout, as he experienced
in himself, when Governor of the
Camp of <em>Danisburg</em>, in the Island of <em>Cormandel</em>,
in the <em>East Indies</em>; that he was
racked with the Gout upon his Return into
<em>Europe</em>; that <em>Tea</em> removes Intoxication, renders
Men active in transacting Business, and
prevents Sleep. Though I do not in the
least doubt of the Truth of these Assertions,
yet I shall prove, that the true <em>Myrtle</em>, is
possessed of the same, and other excellent
Qualities; since it not only seems to be, but
really is, a Species of <em>Tea</em>. If, therefore, the
Leaves of the <em>Danish</em> and <em>German</em> Myrtle,
called <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, vary much among
themselves, and greatly resemble <em>Tea</em>, may
we not conclude, that the Leaves of <em>Tea</em>,
the <em>Myrtle</em>, and the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, also agree
in Virtues and Qualities. This is what I
now intend to evince. <cite>Hippocrates</cite>, therefore,
in order to shew the Efficacy of the
<em>Myrtle</em> in curing and removing Diseases, in
<cite>Lib. de Superfætat, Sect. 3.</cite> tells us, that
when the Mouth of the <em>Uterus</em> is præternaturally
constricted, it is opened by a Suffumigation,
for which Purpose, among other
Things, he orders green <em>Myrtle</em> Leaves contused.
He prescribes them green, and not
dry, because the former most abound with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Sulphur and volatile Parts; whereas the latter
contain little of these; but, on account
of their terrestrial, and somewhat hot Parts,
are violently drying; for which Crasis and
Diversity of Parts, as <em>Myrtle</em> is but gently,
or hardly, hot at all, <cite>Galen</cite> calls it cold.
This Effect, therefore, mentioned by <cite>Hippocrates</cite>,
evinces, that <em>Myrtle</em> consists of very
subtle Parts, and is of a highly drying Quality.
I am surprized, that the Writers of
the <em>Chinese</em> History, have not determined,
whether <em>Tea</em> was beneficial for both Sexes.
The same <cite>Hippocrates</cite>, in <cite>Lib. 1. de Morb.
Mulieb. Sect. 5. Ver. 6.</cite> among other Things
proper for expelling a corrupted <em>F&oelig;tus</em>, prescribes
<em>Myrtle-Berries</em>, <em>Sweet Flag</em>, and <em>Lentiles</em>,
boiled in Wine, and, a little after, he recommends
<em>Pessary</em> of the Leaves of <em>Myrtle</em> for
the same Purpose: And in <cite>Lib. de Natur. Muliebr.
Sect. 5.</cite> he orders the Fruit of the <em>Black
Myrtle</em> macerated in Water, and mixed up
with fine Flower, to be exhibited as a Medicine
for rendering the Body soluble, and
opening the <em>Uterus</em>. <em>Galen</em> also, in <cite>Lib. 7.
Med. Simpl.</cite> informs us, "That <em>Myrtle</em> consists
of contrary and heterogeneous Substances,
that a cold and terrestrial Principle,
however, predominates in it, notwithstanding
which, it has a certain subtile
Heat, in consequence of which, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of an highly drying Nature: That the
Leaves, the Buds, the Fruit, and the
Juice, have different Degrees of Astringency;
that the dried Leaves are more
exsiccant than such as are green; and that
all Parts of the Plant are of an astringent
Quality, whether used internally or externally."
The same Author, in <cite>Lib. 2. de
Aliment. Facultat. Cap. 18.</cite> affirms, that, like
the Fruit of the <em>Juniper</em>, it nourishes little,
though it is possessed of a contrary Quality:
"For, <em>says he</em>, it is highly astringent; and,
for that Reason, stops Fluxes; but its
Coldness does not bear a Proportion to
the Degree of its Astringency." (Circumstances
which ought to be carefully adverted
to in investigating the Virtues of <em>Tea</em>, the
<em>Myrtle</em>, and the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>) "because
it is not only astringent, but also possessed
of a certain Acrimony. Besides, it is peculiar
to all Aliments, possessed of a strong
medicinal Quality, to lose that Quality,"
(which Words I would have the Reader
carefully observe) "by boiling, roasting, or
Maceration; after which they afford but
little Nourishment, and before none at
all: This holds true in Onions and
Leeks." <cite>Diascorides</cite>, in <cite>Lib. 1. Cap. 156</cite>,
tells us, "That the <em>Myrtle</em> and its Seeds are
of an astringent Quality; and, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Juice expressed from the green Berries,
produces the same Effects, is beneficial to
the Stomach, creates a Discharge of Urine,
and cures the Bites of venomous Spiders
and Scorpions, if drank in Wine." He
also informs us, that there are two Kinds of
<em>Myrtles</em>, in like Manner as there are two
Kinds of <em>Tea</em>, sent into <em>Europe</em>, by the <em>Chinese</em>.
<cite>Athenæus</cite>, in <cite>Deipnosophist. Lib. 15.</cite>
tells us, "That such of the <em>Greeks</em> as were
afflicted with Head-achs by drinking too
much Wine at their Feasts, stood in need
of a Remedy for their Disorder, which,
by a certain Instinct of Nature, they knew
to be most expeditiously removed by
Bundles of Flowers, and especially by
Garlands wore on the Head; for, according
to <cite>Andreas</cite>, when any one was seized
with an Head-ach, his Pain was forthwith
alleviated by tying it tight up:"
(This may be accounted for from <cite>Harvey's</cite>
late Discovery of the <cite>Circulation of the Blood</cite>)
"For this Reason they swathed the Heads
of those who had drank to Excess, with
a Crown wove of an hederaceous Plant,
which is plentifully produced without any
Culture, which is sufficiently beautiful, and
throws a grateful Shade over Forehead and
Eyes. For this Reason such Crowns seem
to have been dedicated to <em>Bacchus</em>, who
both invented Wine, and was supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
remove the Disorders produced by it: But,
in process of Time, Mankind became so
voluptuous, that they were not content to
have the Effects of Drunkenness removed
by this Disorder; but also sought to gratify
their Smell and Eyes. Then they
began to use a Crown of <em>Myrtle</em>, which is
astringent, and dispels the Exhalations of
Wine, or a Garland of Roses, which, in
some measure, alleviates the Pain of the
Head, and cools those who are overheated
by excessive Drinking: But over their
Cups, they never used the Laurel, which
is heating, and of a disagreeable Smell:
They also rejected Violets, which by their
Smell offend the Head, and every other
Thing, which could either create Uneasiness,
or produce Obstructions." And afterwards,
he declares himself of <cite>Philonis'</cite>s
Opinion, in the following Words: "But I
am intirely of the Sentiments of <cite>Philonis</cite>,
who affirmed, that a Crown of <em>Myrtle</em>
dispelled the Vapours of Wine, and a
Garland of <em>Roses</em> refrigerated and alleviated
the Pain of the Head." <cite>Bodæus, a Stapelen.</cite>
in <cite>Comment. Lib. 4. Hist. Plant. Theophr.</cite>
informs us, from <cite>Clemens Alexandrinus</cite>,
"that the <em>Myrtle</em> was efficacious for exciting
Laughter, which is represented as the Concomitant
of <em>Venus:</em>" And he adds, that
<em>Myrtle</em> was supposed to be so grateful to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Goddess, that all who celebrated her Festivals,
were adorned with Crowns of it. The
same Author, from <cite>Athenæus</cite> informs us, that
the <em>Lesbians</em> crowned themselves with Wreaths
of <em>Myrtle</em> Twigs, which they called <em>Hypothymidæ</em>;
because, as he tells us, they refreshed
and revived the Brain by their grateful
Fragrance. Those who desire to know
more concerning the Virtues of the <em>Myrtle</em>,
may consult the <cite>Histor. Plantar. Universal.
Ebrodunens. Herbarior. Lib. 5. Cap. 1.</cite>
where, what we have advanced, is farther
confirmed, or similar Qualities of the <em>Myrtle</em>
ascertained. But we proceed to enquire into
the Virtues and Qualities of the <em>Myrtus
Brabantica</em>, or <em>Chamelæagnus</em>. Though a
great deal is not said of this Plant, which
<cite>Bauhine</cite> calls the <em>Rhus Myrtifolia Belgica</em>,
either by the antient or modern Botanists;
yet that it is possessed of singular Virtues, is
evinced from this, that <cite>Pliny</cite>, in <cite>Lib. 24.
Cap. 11.</cite> informs us, that the Herb called
<em>Rhus</em>, which, according to <cite>Clusius</cite> and <cite>Dodonæus</cite>,
is our <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, expels Poison,
and cures scalled Heads; a signal Proof, that
whether green, or dry, it abounds with a singular
volatile Salt and Sulphur; which is also
farther confirmed, partly by its acrid, tho'
not ungrateful Smell, and partly by the Effects
it produces. This is sufficiently confirmed
by the Authority of <cite>Dodonæus</cite>, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
speaks of its Qualities and Virtues in the following
Manner: "Its Seeds, <em>says he</em>, are intensely
hot and dry, almost in the third
Degree: Its Leaves are also hot and dry,
though in a much smaller Degree: Its
Fruit, which is prejudicial to the Brain,
when used in preparing Ale, which is
customary with many, renders the Ale
highly offensive to the Head, and soon
productive of Intoxication or Drunkenness.
The whole Shrub, and its Fruit,
when dried, and laid among Clothes, preserve
them from Moths and Worms." It
also banishes Dormice, as I have observed in
my <cite>Quadripartit. Botan.</cite> Besides, a certain
Person of great Distinction in <cite>Holstein</cite>, and a
Man of the strictest Veracity, informs me,
that the <em>Polanders</em> use our <em>Chamelæagnus</em> for
killing the Lice of their Hogs; for, if this
Plant is strewed under them in their Styes,
the Lice which infest them will be destroyed
in a few Hours; nor will their Nits ever
become alive. Besides, Serpents are never
found to have their Holes in those Forests,
which produce the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, nor are
they ever observed to come near it, much less
to creep through it, as I have been informed
by Forest-Keepers of great Veracity. It is
not, therefore, to be denied, but the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>
is an Herb of singular and excellent
Virtues, since it produces these, and a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
many other uncommon Effects. <cite>Dalechampius</cite>,
Author of the <cite>Herbarum Lugdunense</cite>,
in <cite>Cap. 1.</cite> gives us the following Account of
it: "The <em>Rhus Sylvestris Dodonæi</em>, and the
<em>Rhus Plinii</em> seems to be another Plant,
which is by some called the <em>Myrtus</em>, by
others the <em>Pseudomyrsine</em>, and the <em>Myrtus
Brabantica</em>. It is a low, woody, hard Plant,
with many Branches, which bear pretty
long Leaves, not unlike those of the <em>Box-Tree</em>.
Between the Branches rise many
Twigs, bearing, as it were, a great Number
of Ears, which are, at first, loaded
with many small Flowers, and afterwards
with a Congeries of many angular Seeds,
full of a certain pingueous Humour, of the
same bitter Taste with the Leaves, Flowers,
and Fruit, but of a pleasant grateful Smell.
The Inhabitants of <em>Roan</em> in <em>Normandy</em>,
whose dark and gloomy Forests produce
great Quantities of it, call it <em>Piment Royale</em>,
as it were <em>Melyssophyllum Regium</em>. The
Country People in <em>Summer</em> gather the
Branches loaded with the Leaves and
Seeds, tie them up in small Bundles, for
no other Purpose, but to give Clothes an
agreeable Scent, and hinder them from
being corroded by Worms and Moths.
Its highly bitter Taste evinces that it is
remarkably drying and discutient, and that
it is in a peculiar Manner adapted to kill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and expel Worms, whether exhibited internally,
or applied externally: It flowers
in the Months of <em>May</em> and <em>June</em>, and
bears Fruit in <em>July</em> and <em>August</em>." An
anonymous Author, who makes some Additions
to <cite>Dodonæus</cite>, speaks of it in the following
Manner: "The <em>Gagel</em> has, in <em>English</em>,
the Appellation of Gold from the
Gold-coloured Flowers, or the clammy
sulphureous Matter lodged between the
Seeds and their Husks. <em>Gagel</em> is, by some,
esteemed a good Remedy, in all Cases,
wherein the true <em>Myrtus</em> is used; but this
Opinion is false: The Flowers and the
clammy sulphureous Substance lodged between
the Seeds, and their Husks, are,
by some, accounted good in Consumptions
and all other Disorders of the Breast.
These are also used in making Gold;
others use the whole Plant as an Antidote
against Poison. Some put <em>Gagel</em> into
Beer instead of Hops; whilst others put
it into Must, affirming, that it gives the
Wine an agreeable Flavour, without injuring
the Brain." These last Words excellently
describe those Virtues of the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>,
in which it agrees with the <em>Chinese
Tea</em>, especially as the Author had before
informed us, that, in consequence of
its abounding with a viscid, yellowish Dew,
or roscid Sulphur, it was of a drying Qua<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>lity,
and that it has hitherto been despised,
as an Herb possessed of no other Virtues,
than that of intoxicating, when Ale is prepared
with it; and certainly, this Effect is
to be ascribed to no other Cause, than the
large Quantity of Sulphur contained in the
<em>Chamelæagnus</em>: But I am sensible, that I
am entering upon chymical Principles,
which I have fully explained in another
Work, when treating of malignant Fevers,
and especially the Nature, Genius, and Effects
of volatile Salts and Sulphurs. Now, as
no one has hitherto contradicted any of my
Opinions, I hope this seeming Paradox, with
respect to <em>Tea</em>, will meet with the like favourable
Reception; for, from the Comparison
instituted between the <em>Chinese Tea</em>, and
the true <em>Myrtle</em>, it is evident, that they
agree, not only in Form, but also in Virtues
and Faculties: And as, not only <em>Tea</em>, but
also the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, is like the true <em>Myrtle</em>,
and may be used as a Succedaneum to it, we
cannot doubt, but the <em>Chamelæagnus</em> is the
genuine <em>Cha</em> of the <em>Tartars</em>, or <em>Thee</em> of the
<em>Chinese</em>; and as I have sufficiently demonstrated
this, I hope the <em>Europeans</em> will not,
for the future, be so foolish, as to despise
the <em>Tea</em> produced in their own Climate, in
comparison of that which is brought from
<em>China</em>: Besides, that <em>Tea</em> is nothing else but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
our <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, may be proved by the
following Syllogism.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
    <p>Whatever Things agree in Form and Virtues,
    are of the same Species:</p>

    <p>The <em>Cha</em> of the <em>Tartars</em>, the <em>Thee</em> of
    the <em>Chinese</em>, and our <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, agree
    in Form and Virtues:</p>

    <p>Therefore, they are all of the same Species
    and Kind.</p>
</div>

<p>But Physicians may object, that I am still bewildered,
and at a Loss; since the <em>Chinese Tea</em>,
and our <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, produce different Effects:
For, as all the Effects which the <em>Chinese</em>
or <em>Indians</em> ascribe to their <em>Tea</em>, seem to arise
from the Diversity of its Parts, some of which
are moderately warm, others excessively dry,
some gross, and some subtle: Hence, both
<em>Tea</em> and the true <em>Myrtle</em>, prevent Intoxication;
nay, an Infusion of <em>Tea</em> surprizingly keeps
those who drink it in <em>China</em>, from sleeping
for some Nights. It may, therefore, be objected
to me, that the <em>Chamelæagnus</em> is so far
from preventing or removing Drunkenness,
that it forthwith intoxicates the Person who
drinks the Ale in which it has been boiled;
but these Effects are as diametrically opposite
to each other, as those others are of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
<em>Chinese Tea</em> removing an <em>Hemicrania</em>, and
Head-achs, and the <em>European Chamelæagnus</em>
exciting them: I answer, all this is true;
but, at the same time, it is to be remembered,
that <em>Galen</em> every where demonstrates,
of how great Efficacy, the Diversity
of Parts, in a compound Body, is; a memorable
Example of which he has given, in
<em>Acorns</em> arrived at perfect Maturity, in <cite>Tr. de
Composit. Medicament. Loc. 1. Lib. 6.</cite> I shall
not affirm, that this Diversity of Parts alone,
is sufficient to account for all the Effects
produced by Tea, and the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>:
But I am of Opinion, that both considered,
with respect to their whole Substance, and
the Mixture of Parts peculiar to each, act not
so much by their weak Heat, as by their
excellent drying Virtues; so that they produce
their respective Effects only by their
primary or secondary Qualities. But I can
easily prove, whence this Disagreement of
Qualities derives its Origin. We are, therefore,
to consider, that the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>
abounds with a Salt, and a glutinous Sulphur,
of which, according to <cite>Dodonæus</cite>, the Seeds
and Fruit cannot be destitute: But, I deny
that this Sulphur is, in the least, offensive to
the Brain and Nerves; and affirm, that like
the Wreaths of <em>Myrtles</em>, wore by the <em>Lesbians</em>,
it, by its Fragrance, comforts and
revives the Brain; for, if it was otherwise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
I do not see how Ministers and Ambassadors
to the Courts of <em>China</em>, should often, by
the Use of <em>Tea</em>, be enabled to attend Business
for whole Nights, without sleeping: This
Account, however, must either be confirmed,
or refuted, by Experience. <cite>Diogenes Laertius</cite>
informs us, that <em>Democritus</em>, when nothing
else could be of any Service to him,
protracted his Life three Days longer, only
by the refreshing Smell of Bread, newly
taken from an Oven. Thus, also, the moderate
Use of Wine revives, corroborates,
and, by its Sulphur, dries the Nerves; which
is sufficiently known by Dancers, who frequently
bath their Feet in Wine, in order to
strengthen them; and by Musicians, who
take the same Measures with their Hands:
And if other Persons would frequently bathe
their Feet and Hands with Wine, impregnated
either with <em>Rosemary</em>, <em>Sage</em>, or <em>Betony</em>,
it is incredible, how much it would contribute
to their Health. Besides, it may happen,
that, by this Means, malignant Disorders may
be prevented. This Redundance, therefore,
of a volatile Sulphur in the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>,
which palpably affects the Smell of those
who walk in Copsy Ground, disturbs the
Brain, intoxicates, and produces Head-achs.
Thus, in Wine-Vaults, a Person is intoxicated
by drinking, sooner than elsewhere,
because the Wine, though contained in close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Casks, sends forth sulphureous Exhalations,
which escape the Sight. It is certain, that
the <em>Tartars</em> import their <em>Cha</em>, or <em>Chamelæagnus</em>,
into <em>China</em>; but, it is not, to me,
probable, that they prepare it in the same
Manner with the <em>Chinese</em>: For, if we consider
the Customs and Regimen of the <em>Tartars</em>,
we find them intolerably addicted to
Drunkenness; notwithstanding which, they
are very robust and hardy: Hence, if they
eat Herbs crude, and also boiled, as they do
their <em>Baltracan</em>, it is probable, they toast
their <em>Cha</em>, or dry it, and use it, whether after
a <em>Crapula</em>, or not, and whether they are afflicted
with a Pain of the Head, or not; provided
they are intoxicated with it, as the
Country People of <em>Europe</em> are with the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>
In order to correct this intoxicating
Quality of the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, the <em>Chinese</em>
gather the Leaves in the <em>Spring</em>, and
not in the <em>Summer</em>: Now, it is sufficiently
certain, from chemical Observations, that the
sulphureous Parts of Herbs are easily exhaled.
This was well enough known to <em>Galen</em>, since,
in <cite>Lib. de Aliment. Facultat. Cap. 18.</cite> he
tells us, that the drastic Qualities of Substances,
that is, their saline, sulphureous, and volatile
Parts, are corrected, or drawn out by
boiling, roasting, or Maceration. Hence,
the <em>Chinese</em> toast, or carefully dry their <em>Tea</em>,
in a Stove; after which, they macerate it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
for a Quarter of an Hour in warm Water,
but do not boil it, lest, by that Means, it
should be deprived of all its Virtues: Thus,
it is sufficiently known, that <em>Rhubarb</em> is deprived
of its purgative Qualities by toasting
it, and <em>Alexandrian Senna</em> by being boiled,
and strongly expressed. If, therefore, as I before
hinted, the <em>Europeans</em> would imitate
the <em>Chinese</em>, they would only use those Leaves
of the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, which are gathered in
the <em>Spring</em>; but not the Shrub itself, nor the
Flowers, nor Seeds, boiled in Ale instead of
Hops; for the Leaves ought only to be macerated:
Nor is it probable, that the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>
would intoxicate so soon, if it was intirely
deprived of its Seeds; for this Effect is
produced by the Sulphur which abounds in
other Herbs and Shrubs, as well as the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>,
and is sometimes more, and
sometimes less volatile, or fixed: Thus, the
Scent of the Heart of the <em>Moschatella</em> is intirely
lost, by being frequently smelled. The
<em>Geranium Moschatum</em> also, has this peculiar
to itself, that when it appears half withered,
it emits no Smell; but sends forth a strong
one when gently rubbed between the Hands;
for if it should be bruised, the Labour would
be lost. <em>Rue</em> also contains so volatile a Sulphur,
that, when it is dry, it has almost no
Colour, whilst its Seeds are oleous and sulphureous.
<em>Wormwood</em> holds a Kind of Medium,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
consisting of one highly volatile Principle,
which greatly affects the Head; for which
Reason some would have it washed in warm
Water before it is used for the Preparation
of the <em>Vinum Absinthites</em>, and another of a
more fixed Nature; as also a volatile and
fixed Salt: Thus, also, <em>Garlick, Mother of
Thyme</em>, and especially the <em>Laurel</em>, abound
in Sulphur, as well as the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, in
which, indeed, it is more slowly and difficultly
consumed, than in the others. When,
in order to investigate the Virtues and Faculties
of the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, I kindled some
Part of it, together with the Seeds; it did
not burn suddenly, like the <em>Juniper</em>, but
slowly, like the <em>Beech</em>, with certain Noises,
or Kinds of Explosions, intermixed. The
Smoak, which filled the whole Laboratory,
was of an acrid Smell, highly resembling
that of the kindled Twigs of the <em>Beech</em>:
Hence, we infer, that the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>
contains a large Quantity of Sulphur and
volatile Salt. From these Reasonings and
Experiments, I think it is sufficiently obvious,
that it is, upon account of the grateful
and duly corrected Sulphur of the <em>Chinese
Chamelæagnus</em>, that the Brain is so much
refreshed, and that Persons who use it in
<em>China</em>, can, without any Loss, sit up whole
Nights in transacting Business; a memorable
Instance of this we have in <cite>Alexander Rhodius</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
who always had Disorders of his Head removed
by drinking it: Whereas, the <em>European
Chamelæagnus</em>, especially that which
is full grown, and abounds with Seeds and
Flowers, when boiled in Ale, intoxicates
those who drink such Ale, procures Sleep, and
excites Head-achs. These Circumstances,
when impartially weighed, will vindicate
me from Partiality, when I despise the costly
<em>Chinese Chamelæagnus</em>, and, in its stead, substitute
our own, a Shrub of uncommon and
excellent Qualities against Poison, and the
Bites of Serpents: Since, according to <cite>Pliny</cite>,
these noxious Animals cannot endure the
Smell of it. These Virtues of the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>,
we can teach the <em>Asiatics</em>, but can
hardly believe that, by Virtue of their <em>Tea</em>,
Persons may sit up all Night, without sustaining
any Loss.</p>

<p>Every one is convinced that two Kinds
of <em>Tea</em> are sold in the Shops, one of a blackish
Colour, and the other of a faint Green;
the one pretty much, and the other far less
crenated: This Variation of the <em>Chinese Tea</em>,
I can sufficiently account for; since <cite>Tulpius</cite>
tells us, that the Leaves of the <em>Chinese Tea</em>
are of a dark green Colour; whereas those
produced in <em>Japan</em> are of a fainter Colour,
and more grateful Taste; for which Reason,
one Pound of the latter is, in the <em>Indies</em>, fre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>quently
sold for an Hundred <em>Libræ</em> of Silver,
or, according to <cite>Trigautius</cite>, only for ten or
twelve <em>Nobles</em>. Notwithstanding this, the
Shopkeepers of <em>Amsterdam</em> and <em>Hamburg</em> sell
a Pound of this Commodity for eight <em>Nobles</em>,
as I have often before observed.</p>

<p>I cannot, on this Occasion, forbear recommending
the Conduct of <cite>Oluis Wormius</cite>,
who, in his <cite>Musæum, Lib. 2. Cap. 14.</cite> informs
us, that he macerated a certain Quantity
of both Kinds of <em>Tea</em>, in warm Water,
and found the Leaves of the one, when spread,
of a dark green Colour, crenated like <em>Rose-Tree</em>
Leaves, oblong, and about an Inch in
Length. Mr. <em>Harford</em>, the King's Apothecary,
made me a Present of two large Boxes full
of <em>Tea</em>, of different Colours: In the one
Box, which contained the green, I found
neither Stalks, nor Flowers, nor Seeds of the
Plant, but only the Leaves; but, in turning
over the <em>Bohea Tea</em>, contained in the
other Box, I found three Stalks, so nearly
resembling those of the <em>Myrtle</em>, that, not
only Mr. <cite>Harford</cite> and I, but also some others,
thought that they might be justly accounted
the Stalks of the <em>Myrtle:</em> This, in so dubious
a Case, is a pretty strong Argument,
that <em>Bohea Tea</em> is adulterated with <em>Myrtle</em>,
which may, very properly, be substituted, in
its stead, or rather exactly agrees with it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
This blacker Species of <em>Tea</em>, or <em>Myrtle</em>, is
far cheaper among the <em>Indians</em> than the
green Kind. The celebrated <cite>Olaus Wormius</cite>,
on account of the vast Diversity in the Leaves
of <em>Tea</em>, suspects that the Leaves of some
other Plant are often sold in their Stead.
This also, as I before observed, often happens
with respect to <em>Tobacco</em>. That I might
not, however, be charged with Rashness, or
falsly accusing the <em>Asiatics</em> of Fraud, I thought
it incumbent upon me, attentively to view
the <em>Chinese Tea</em>; for which Purpose, I ordered
Mr. <cite>Harford</cite>'s two Apprentices, to
pick out some of the largest, and most perfect
<em>Tea</em> Leaves, to be macerated in warm Water,
and then spread and unfolded: Accordingly
they shewed me ten, which were neither
lacerated, nor torn; and two of the most
perfect of which were accurately engraved
by <cite>Albert Halwey</cite>, the King's Engraver. See
<cite>Histor. Cochlear. 4. Class. Quadripartit. Botantic</cite>.
These Leaves were of different Shapes
and Bulks, but so like those of the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>,
that the one could hardly be distinguished
from the other. The Leaves of
the green Kind seemed to be produced by an
Herb, or Shrub, of a quite different Species
from the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, the Leaves of which,
when gathered small, and in the <em>Spring</em>,
make, in my Opinion, the most genuine
<em>Tea</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>But though I have before shewn, from the
Authority of <cite>Bauhine</cite>, that the Leaves of
one and the same <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, sport and
vary considerably from each other; yet, I
would not, because this may also probably
happen to the <em>Chinese Tea</em>, have any one
infer, that, in <em>China</em>, the <em>Tea</em>, which some
maintain to be the <em>Cha</em> of the <em>Tartars</em>, is
not adulterated. I am, indeed, of Opinion,
that it is adulterated, but never either affirmed,
or so much as intended to insinuate, that Nature
sported and varied so in the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>,
either of the <em>Tartars</em>, or <em>Europeans</em>,
as to produce Leaves of a different Species:
Nor is this Variation, and Sporting of Nature,
surprizing in the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>; since
it is equally, if not more, palpable, in Prunes
of different Colours, Peaches, Apricots,
sweet and bitter Almonds, and the Leaves
produced by these Trees. I have often carefully
viewed and turned over all the three
Thousand Plants, with which my Repository
is enriched, in order to see whether any of
them resembled the spurious <em>Chinese Tea</em>, or
that with which the genuine is adulterated;
and I found the Leaves of two Shrubs highly
similar to those of the spurious <em>Tea</em>: The
one is by <cite>Carolus Clusius</cite> in <cite>Lib. 5. Rarior.
Plantar. Histor. Cap. 20.</cite> called <em>Pyrola quarta
Fruticans</em>; and <cite>Bauhine</cite>, in his <cite>Pinax</cite>, calls
it the <em>Pyrola Frutescens Arbuti Folio</em>: The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
other is a Shrub, called by <cite>Clusius</cite>, in <cite>Lib.
1. Histor. Plant. Cap. 53</cite>, the <em>Spiræa Theophrasti</em>,
and by <cite>Bauhine</cite>, <em>Frutex Spicatus
Foliis Salignis Serratus dictus</em>.</p>

<p>As it was expedient to compare my Description
of the <em>Chinese Tea</em> with those which
<cite>Dodonæus</cite> gives of the Herb <em>Betony</em>, and the
<em>Chamelæagnus</em>; so, in this Place, I think it
proper to insert the Descriptions which <cite>Clusius</cite>
has given of the <em>Pyrola Fruticans</em>, and
the <em>Spiræa Theophrasti</em>; the former of which
he describes in the following Manner: "One
Genus of this Plant is sometimes of a
shrubby Nature; for new, short, and small
Branches springing up every Year, remain
firm and green for some Years, and rise
above the Earth, till by their own Weight
they bend downwards, hide themselves in
the Ground, and sometimes send out fibrous
Roots. Two, three, or four small carnous
Leaves generally grow between the
Nods: The superior Parts of these Leaves
are of a deep green Colour, and shining,
whilst, in Form and Bulk, they almost
resemble those of the <em>Chamædaphne</em>, or
<em>Laureola</em>, only they are serrated about the
Edges, and of an highly drying and bitterish
Taste, like the Leaves of the other
Species of <em>Pyrolæ</em>." These last Words
ought carefully to be adverted to. The same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
<cite>Clusius</cite>, in <cite>Lib. 1.</cite> in <cite>Rarior Plantar. Histor.</cite>
describes the <em>Spiræa</em> in the following
Manner: "It rises to about the Height of
two Cubits, with small Branches, or
Twigs, covered with a reddish Bark. Among
these Branches arise, without any
Order, numerous, long, and narrow
Leaves, resembling those of the Willow,
serrated about the Edges, with their superior
Surfaces of a faint green, and their
inferior as if they were besprinkled with
Verdegrease: They are of a drying and
kind of bitter Taste." The last Words
of this Description are also to be carefully
adverted to, since the Leaves of <em>Tea</em> are not
only serrated, but also of a drying and bitter
Taste. As, therefore, the <em>Pyrola Fruticans</em>
of <cite>Clusius</cite>, and the <em>Spiræa</em> of <cite>Theophrastus</cite>,
and especially the former, are of a drying and
bitterish Taste, it is highly probable, that
the <em>Chinese Tea</em> may be adulterated with one,
or both of these; especially, since they not
only greatly resemble each other in Form,
but also in Taste. A Cut of one Leaf of the
<em>Pyrola</em>, I have annexed to the Description
of <em>Scurvy-Grass</em>, in my <cite>Quadripartitium</cite>,
No. 9. and another of a <em>Tea-Leaf</em>, produced
in <em>China</em>. As for a Cut of the <em>Spiræa</em>, the
Curious may have recourse to <cite>Clusius</cite>, or
they may find one Leaf of it accurately engraved
in Plate 2, of this Work; where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
two Leaves of <em>Chinese Tea</em> are engraved.
The larger of these is so like the <em>Spiræa</em>
of <cite>Theophrastus</cite>, both in Length, Breadth,
Bulk, the Course of the Veins, and the Disposition
of the Crenations, that there is hardly
the smallest Possibility of distinguishing
the one from the other: But both these
Leaves are vastly unlike to that <em>Tea</em> Leaf
which, in No. 7. of the last cited Plate, I
ordered to be engraved, with the <em>Cochlearia
Danica</em>: But the other small uncrenated
Leaf is like the <em>Chinese Tea</em>, as the latter is like
the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, which, as I have already
observed, sports and varies very surprizingly
in its Leaves: This latter, I take to be genuine
<em>Tea</em>; whereas, I am of Opinion, that
the former, resembling the <em>Spiræa</em>, is spurious.
Since, therefore, both <em>Tartary</em> and
<em>China</em>, abound with the <em>Pyrola</em>, and the
<em>Spiræa</em> of <cite>Theophrastus</cite>, I think we have just
Reason to conclude, that all the Leaves
sold among us for <em>Tea</em>, have not been gathered
from one Species of Shrub, or Herb, but
are adulterated with those of the <em>Pyrola</em>, the
<em>Spiræa</em>, or some other Shrub; among which,
we may justly reckon the <em>Rhus</em>, or <em>Sumach</em>,
on account of the Similarity of its Leaves,
Flowers, Taste, and Bulk; though I am
sensible, that the celebrated <cite>Bauhine</cite>, in his
<cite>Pinax</cite>, has placed it among the Species of
<em>Agnus Castus</em>, and made it a Kind of inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>mediate
Plant, between the <em>Vitex</em> and <em>Ligustrum</em>,
calling it Frutex <em>Spicatus Foliis Salignis
serratis</em>. In consequence of this, it
seems dubious to what Kind of Shrubs it is
principally to be referred: Its Flowers grow
in a spicated Order, on the Tops of the
Twigs, like those of the <em>Agnus Castus</em>; so
that the <em>Spiræa</em> very much resembles the
<em>Vitex</em>: But, when the Flowers, and crenated
Leaves of the <em>Spiræa</em>, are accurately viewed,
we find, that it is more justly referred to the
<em>Rhus</em>, or <em>Sumach</em>, than to any other Species
of Shrub. As neither <cite>Theophrastus</cite>, <cite>Clusius</cite>,
nor <cite>Bodæus a Stapelen</cite>, have mentioned its
Virtues, I shall not assert that they agree exactly
with these of the <em>Chinese Tea</em>; only,
it is highly probable, that the <em>Chinese Tea</em> is
adulterated with the <em>Spiræa</em>, either by the
<em>Asiatic</em> or <em>European</em> Dealers. Avarice has
not only prompted People to this Piece of
Fraud, but also to lodge <em>Tobacco</em> in Office-Houses,
in order to render it more acrid.
In order to evince how like the <em>Chinese</em>, or
<em>Japonese Tea</em> is to the <em>Spiræa</em>, I refer the
Reader to <cite>Tab. 1. Fig. 6, &amp; 7</cite>, the former
of which is a Leaf of <em>Tea</em>, and the latter
that of the <em>Spiræa</em>.</p>

<p>Happening one Day to visit <cite>Hieronymus
Molmanus</cite>, a learned Jesuit, to whom I communicated
my Paradox about <em>Tea</em>; that Gen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>tleman,
upon my commending <cite>Trigautius</cite>
and <cite>Rhodius</cite>, ordered me to read <cite>Martini
Martinii novus Atlas Sinensis</cite>, as the best and
latest Account of the <em>East Indies</em>, or rather
of <em>China</em>. When I found this Work, I was
glad to meet with a Description of the <em>Cha</em>,
in the Account of the Town <em>Hojechu</em> in <em>Nanquin</em>,
in which the Author affirms, that it is
no where better and more valuable. <cite>Martinius</cite>
informs us, that the <em>Chinese Tea</em> belongs
to the <em>Rhus</em>, and is highly similar to it:
But this <em>Rhus</em>, as I have already shewn from
<cite>Pliny</cite>, <cite>Clusius</cite>, <cite>Dodonæus</cite>, and <cite>Dalechampius</cite>,
is the same with our <em>Chamelæagnus</em>. Hence,
it is not only obvious in itself, but confirmed
by the Authority of <cite>Martinius</cite>, that
the <em>Chinese</em> are guilty of Fraud and Imposture
in adulterating their <em>Tea</em>.</p>

<p>The Description which <cite>Martinius</cite> gives
of the <em>Thee</em>, is as follows: "The Leaves,
most commonly known by the Name of
<em>Cha</em>, are no where more valuable, than in
the Province of <em>Nanquin</em>; and, for the
Sake of the Curious, I shall describe them
as briefly as possible. The Leaf is exactly
similar to that produced by the <em>Rhus Coriaria</em>;
and I am apt to think the former
is a certain Species of the latter, though
the <em>Thee</em> is not wild, but cultivated, is not
a Tree, but a Kind of Shrub, sending forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
various small Branches: The Flowers of
the one do not much differ from those
of the other, except that those of the
latter are of a more yellowish White than
those of the former. The <em>Tea</em> flowers in
the <em>Spring</em>, and the Flower emits a gently
fragrant Smell. It is succeeded by a green
Berry, which soon assumes a blackish Colour:
The tender Leaves appearing in
the <em>Spring</em>, are thought best. These,
when gathered, they put into an Iron
Pan, over a slow Fire, and heat them a
little; then they put them in a thin fine
Cloth, and again expose them to the Fire,
till they are intirely dry, and shrunk up.
When thus prepared, they generally keep
them close stopped leaden Vessels, in order
to prevent Evaporation, and the free Access
of the Air. After they have been kept a long
Time, they resume their primitive Verdure,
and expand themselves when put into boiling
Water, in which they produce a greenish
Colour, and communicate to it a pretty
grateful Taste, especially to those who are
accustomed to drink it. The <em>Chinese</em>
greatly extol the Virtues of this warm Liquor,
which they frequently use by Day
and Night, making it the common Entertainment
for Strangers and Visitors.
The Price is very various, since a Pound
ascends from an Halfpenny, to two, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
more, <em>Nobles</em>: To this Liquor, it is
principally said to be owing, that the
<em>Chinese</em> are never afflicted with the Gout
and Stone. When drank after Meals, it
removes Crudity and Indigestion, for it
greatly assists Concoction: It affords Relief
after hard Drinking, and Surfeits of
every Kind; for it is of a drying Quality,
removes superfluous Humours, expels somniferous
Vapours, and prevents Drowsiness
and Oppression in those who incline
to study: It has various Names in <em>China</em>,
according to the Places where it is produced,
and the different Prices of it. The
best in <em>Nanquin</em>, is generally called <em>Sunglocha</em>.
For a farther Account, the Curious
may consult <cite>Rhodius de Regno Tunking</cite>."
<cite>Martinius</cite> also informs us, that
the City <em>Luchen</em>, in the Province of <em>Kiangnan</em>,
is celebrated both for the great Quantities,
and the Goodness of its <em>Tea</em>.</p>

<p>I could heartily wish, that all the practical
Physicians in <em>Europe</em> would concur to
giving a Sanction to this Doctrine by their
Practice; for, besides the Testimonies of
<cite>Trigautius</cite> and <cite>Rhodius</cite>, I am certain from
Experience, that the <em>Cha</em> is the <em>Rhus Coriaria</em>,
or a certain Species of it, whose Qualities
and Marks are known from what has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
been already said. I do not, in the least,
doubt, but the <em>Cha</em> of the <em>Tartars</em>, or the
<em>Thee</em> of the <em>Chinese</em>, is our <em>Chamelæagnus</em>,
or <cite>Pliny</cite>'s Herb <em>Rhus</em>; especially since <cite>Clusius</cite>,
in <cite>Auctar. Exoticor. Libror</cite>. expresly
asserts, that from the Cuts of some <em>Chinese</em>
Books, which <cite>Pavius</cite> and <cite>Joseph Scaliger</cite>
received in a Present from some <em>East India</em>
Merchants, though coarsely engraved, he
perceived that many <em>Chinese</em> Plants are exactly
similar to some of those produced in
<em>Europe</em>. This Circumstance renders it highly
probable, that <em>China</em> which borders upon
<em>Tartary</em>, produces our <em>Chamelæagnus</em>. I am
heartily sorry, however, that I have not had
an Opportunity of conversing with <cite>Martinius</cite>
on this Subject, since, according to
<cite>Galen</cite>, in <cite>Lib. de Compos. Med. Cap. 3.</cite> reading
an Author's Works, is not so satisfactory,
as a personal Conversation with him.
However, as I have only followed Reason,
and the Course of my own Thoughts, I
hope I shall have no Cause to repent my
Labour; since, according to <cite>Cornelius Tacitus</cite>,
in <cite>Annal. 15.</cite> many Things are obtained
by Experiments and Efforts, which, to the
lazy and sluggish Part of Mankind, seemed
highly difficult, if not impossible. Thus the
<em>Romans</em>, by Bravery and Activity, raised their
originally petty State, to a most extensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and powerful Empire. <em>Columbus</em> discovered
<em>America</em> by Reading and making Efforts
for that Purpose. <em>Copernicus</em>, and <em>Ticho
Brahe</em>, by their extensive Acquaintance with
Mathematics, discovered and demonstrated
many important Things, unknown to our
Forefathers. The illustrious <cite>Hoffman</cite>, in
<cite>Paralcip. Officinal</cite>, when giving a noble
Scope to his Imagination, in the Investigation
of Mineral Waters, tells us, that the
advancing probable Things, is an Advantage
to the Cause of Truth, and was always
looked upon as such by <cite>Plato</cite>, <cite>Aristotle</cite>, <cite>Galen</cite>,
and all other Philosophers. Notwithstanding
the incomparable Learning and
Industry of <cite>Martinius</cite>, I cannot comprehend
some Things in his Description of
<em>Tea</em>; for I cannot conceive why he asserts,
that the <em>Rhus Coriaria</em> is not wild, but cultivated
among the <em>Chinese</em>; since <cite>Matthiolus</cite>,
<cite>Bauhine</cite>, and <cite>Hoffman</cite>, do not, with <cite>Galen</cite>,
make a Distinction between the <em>Rhus Coriaria</em>,
and <em>Culinaria</em>, which, by <cite>Trigautius</cite>
and <cite>Rhodius</cite>, is called the <em>Cha</em>, or <em>Thee</em>;
but if <cite>Martinius</cite> had mentioned the <em>Myrtle</em>,
I should have conjectured, that he followed
other Botanists, who exclude the <cite>Myrtus Sylvestris
Dioscoridis</cite>, in the Shops known by
the Name <em>Ruscus</em>, or <em>Bruscus</em>, from the
Species of true <em>Myrtles</em>. Thus <cite>Marcellus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Virgilius</cite>, in <cite>Comment. in Dioscorid. Lib. 1.
Cap. 132.</cite> makes a great Difference between
them in the following Passage: "The
<em>Myrtus Sativa</em> of <cite>Pliny</cite>, which I describe
in this Chapter, is not like other Plants,
sown in continued Tracts of Ground;
and though it thrives better in Gardens,
than in uncultivated Soils, this is not the
only Difference between it and the <em>Myrtus
Agrestis</em>, which is a Plant of an intirely
different Kind, which the <em>Greeks</em>
call <em>Oxymyrsene</em>, and the <em>Latins</em>, <em>Ruscus</em>;
for, upon Comparison, the <em>Myrtle</em> is
milder than the <em>Ruscus</em>, whose cuspidated
Leaves are pricking and sharp. It is,
however, certain, that the <em>Ruscus</em> was,
by some of the Antients, called <em>Myrtus
Sylvestris</em>." I do not remember, that any
Botanist has brought such a Charge against
our <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, since it is universally enumerated
among the Species of true <em>Myrtle</em>,
though of the wild Kind. The Reason
why <cite>Martinius</cite> calls the <em>Chamelæagnus</em> a
cultivated Plant, as I suppose, is, because
the <em>Chinese</em>, seeing us so fond of <em>Tea</em>, have
begun to cultivate it, in order to draw the
Profits arising from it, just as the <em>Europeans</em>
do the Vine, for the Sake of the Grapes,
the <em>Persians</em> the <em>Mulberry-Tree</em>, for the Silk;
the Inhabitants of <em>Narbon</em> and <em>Provence</em>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
<em>Ilex Coceigera</em>, for the Sake of the <em>Cochineal</em>;
or the <em>Americans</em> the <em>Tobacco</em>, on account of
the large Quantities of it imported into <em>Europe</em>.
As <cite>Trigautius</cite> thinks it not impossible
for <em>Tea</em> to grow in some Parts of <em>Europe</em>,
and as <cite>Rhodius</cite> affirms, that the <em>Chinese</em> are
as busy in the Time of gathering their <em>Tea</em>,
as the <em>Europeans</em> are in their Harvest; so,
it is probable, that some Tracts of Land
may be sown with <em>Tea</em> in <em>China</em>; notwithstanding
which, it is more agreeable
to the usual Way of speaking, to call <em>Tea</em>
rather a wild, than cultivated Shrub. The
<em>Chinese</em> also, according to <cite>Rhodius</cite>, do not
gather all the Leaves produced by the Shrub,
but only such as appear first in the <em>Spring</em>,
and are soft and tender, which they also
gather, one after another. Hence I infer,
that the Leaves in the <em>Summer</em>, are very unlike
those in the <em>Spring</em>, which is also observed
in those of our <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, with
respect to Softness, Smoothness, and Colour;
so that it is not to be wondered at, if the
<em>Chinese Chamelæagnus</em> appears milder than
our own; since they collect, prepare, and
dry theirs in a quite different Manner from
us: "For, first, they put it in an Iron
Pan, and warm it gently over a slow Fire;
then, they wrap it up in a smooth, thin
Cloth, and again expose it to the Fire, till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
it is corrugated, and shrivelled up." Hence
it is, that our <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, when macerated
in warm Water, is of a different Colour,
Taste, and Smell from the <em>Chinese Tea</em>,
though their Effects are the same, only those
of the former are stronger and more considerable
than those of the latter. If, therefore,
in our Country, the <em>Chamelæagnus</em> was
gathered with the same Circumstances, Pains,
and Precautions observed by the <em>Chinese</em>, I
doubt not but it would be equal to, their
<em>Tea</em>; for if the same Measures are not taken
in the Preparation of the same Herb,
how is it possible, that it should produce similar
and uniform Effects, especially if the one
is gathered in the <em>Spring</em>, and the other in
the End of the <em>Summer</em>: The one artificially
dried in the House, and the other dried in
the open Air by the Heat of the Sun; the
one collected when it begins to appear, and
other when the Plant is full of a roscid, sulphureous
Dew, and bears Flowers, and Seeds. For
this Reason, <cite>Scherbius</cite> justly observes, "That
when many Things concur to the Production
of the same Effect; all these
Things ought to be exactly the same."
<cite>Hoffman</cite>, in <cite>Comment. Lib. 7.</cite> represents this
Doctrine in the following accurate and beautiful
Manner: "Individual Objects often
appear to our Senses to have no Difference;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
whereas, a very considerable one is observed
in their Effects. This Circumstance
constitutes that Individuality, which
cannot be described, and which, I remember,
<cite>Scherbius</cite>, my old Master, used to illustrate
by the following <em>Simile</em>: If a Bell-Founder
should make twenty small Bells,
of the same Metal, in the same Mould,
at the same Time, and in the same Place;
yet the Sound of no one of them will
be perfectly similar to that of another.
What can be the Cause of this Variation?
The Artist, the Mould, the Metal, and
the Fire, concur to produce the same
Effects, which, however, is not obtained.
Besides, if we were carefully to examine
these Bells by the Sight, the Touch, the
Weight and other Circumstances, we can
discover no Difference; which, however,
is sufficiently evinced by the Sound. Some
Things, said my Matter, can neither
be described, nor expressed, and of this
Kind are these Differences. Perhaps, in
this Case, there is not an equable Thickness
of the Metal, because the Fire has
not equably pervaded all its Particles. Perhaps
the Surface is not every where smooth
because the fused Metal might have been in
some Parts more refrigerated than in others:
and perhaps, there maybe other Variations;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
for, unless all Circumstances exactly concur,
the same Sound cannot be produced
in all the Bells." I have quoted this
Passage from <cite>Hoffman</cite>, lest any Person, observing
some Differences between our <em>Chamelæagnus</em>,
and the <em>Chinese</em>, or <em>Tartars Tea</em>,
should forthwith doubt,&mdash;whether they are
Shrubs of the same Species, as I have already
proved them to be. The <em>Chinese Tea</em>, therefore,
and our <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, are Shrubs of
the same Species; though, for the former,
we go beyond the <em>Cape of Good Hope</em>, into
<em>China</em>, cross the <em>Equator</em> four Times in every
Voyage, and expose ourselves to uncommon
Hardships and Dangers, in order to bring
Home the Leaves of an unknown Shrub,
which has not the same Virtues and Qualities
for which the <em>Chinese Tea</em> is celebrated
in <em>China</em>, and to which our <em>European Betony</em>
is preferable. Since, therefore, the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>
is now sufficiently known, we
have no more Occasion for <em>Tea</em> from <em>China</em>,
than we have for <em>Arum</em> from <em>Asia</em>, <em>Wormwood</em>
from <em>Pontus</em>, or <em>Scordium</em> from <em>Crete</em>.</p>

<p>I now proceed to consider the peculiar
Virtues commonly supposed to reside in <em>Tea</em>,
but which I assert are equally to be found
in <em>European</em> Plants; for the <em>Chinese</em> are
guilty of a fulsome Exaggeration, when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
assert that it has a Tendency to prolong
Life. The Virtues, then, of the <em>Tea</em>, seem
to be most accurately described by <cite>Rhodius</cite>
and <cite>Martinius</cite>, who seem to have reduced
them to three Heads; the first of which,
according to <cite>Rhodius</cite>, is, that it alleviates
Pains of the Head, and represses Vapours:
The second, that it corroborates the Stomach:
And, the third, that it expels the
Stone and Gravel from the Kidneys. These
Virtues are, by <cite>Martinius</cite>, recited in the
following Order: To the drinking of this
warm Liquor, it is said to be owing, that
the <em>Chinese</em> are Strangers to the Gout and
Stone. When drank after Meals, it removes
Crudities and Indigestion. When exhibited
to drunken Persons, it affords them Relief,
and prevents the bad Consequences of Surfeits;
for it is of a drying Nature, carries off
superfluous Humours, expels somniferous
Vapours, and removes the languid State of
Students, who are oppressed by long Application.
These Virtues are, at present, to be
carefully examined. I shall not here speak
of those Qualities, which are the Result of
its Temperature; since I before evinced, that
the whole Substance of the <em>Tea</em> was grateful
to the Brain; but at the same time
shewed, from a singular Observation, that
<em>Betony</em> was possessed of the same Virtues and
Qualities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>First, then, it is asserted of <em>Tea</em>, that it
removes the bad Consequences of Surfeits,
because it is of a drying Nature, and carries
off superfluous Humours: The same Effects
are also produced by <em>Betony</em>: But as for the
Expulsion of somniferous Vapours, and removing
the languid State of hard Students;
these Properties are more frequently ascribed
to the true <em>Myrtle</em>, than to <em>Betony</em>; which,
however, as we shall afterwards shew, is
also recommended against Intoxication.</p>

<p>The second Virtue of <em>Tea</em> macerated in
warm Water, is, that it corroborates the
Stomach; which Effect is also remarkably
produced by <em>Betony</em>.</p>

<p>The third Virtue it is said to be possessed
of, is, that it frees the Kidneys from Stones
and Gravel; for which Reason, according
to <cite>Martinius</cite>, the <em>Chinese</em> are Strangers to
nephritic and arthritic Disorders. <em>Betony</em>
remarkably produces this Effect, and, at the
same time, is a powerful Preservative against
the Gout. The other Qualities of <em>Tea</em>, enumerated
by other Authors: I shall not here
mention, that I may, at more Length, compare
it with <em>Betony</em>. The Reader may,
however, consult my <cite>Quadripartitium</cite>, and
<cite>Antonius Musa</cite>, who, in <cite>Libell. de Betonica</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
affirms, that <em>Betony</em> is possessed of so excellent
medicinal Virtues, that it cures no
less than forty-seven Disorders; which none
of the <em>Chinese</em> have ever dared to assert,
concerning their <em>Tea</em>: The <em>Asiatic Tea</em> is,
therefore, far inferior to the <em>European Betony</em>.
The same Author affirms, "That
<em>Betony</em>, previously taken, prevents Intoxication."
By which Words, <cite>Musa</cite> insinuates,
that it guards against a Surfeit, and,
consequently, frees us from Drowsiness; so
that the whole Substance of it is equally
grateful and refreshing to the Brain with
<em>Tea</em>. It were to be wished, that this Physician
had directed the Method of preparing
<em>Betony</em>, in order to prevent Intoxication;
by which Means the <em>Europeans</em> would, in
all Probability, have been encouraged to
greater Care and Diligence in cultivating,
drying, and separating the small from the
large Leaves of our <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, a Decoction
of whose Flowers would have been
as grateful to them as that of the <em>Chinese Tea</em>
is to them. But if any should foolishly
dread the Use of the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, which,
however, is much used, and greatly extolled
in <em>Denmark</em>, and the Lower <em>Saxony</em>; such
Persons may, I think, substitute <em>Betony</em> in
its Room. But, if a Physician should order
an <em>European</em> Cobler, or Day-Labourer, fre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>quently
to use a Decoction of <em>Betony</em>, they
would sneeringly bid him use his insipid
Water himself. But the Custom of drinking
<em>Tea</em> only prevails, because it is a new
Thing, unknown to the Forefathers of the
<em>Chinese</em>, and is imported from <em>Asia</em> into
<em>Europe</em>, whose Inhabitants of all Ranks are
so excessively fond of it, on account of its
grateful Bitter, and sub-astringent Taste:
The same may be said of the <em>Indian Chocolate</em>,
and the Water impregnated with
the <em>Chavva</em> of the <em>Persians</em>, since these three
Liquors have generally no more grateful a
Taste, than a Decoction of coarse <em>European</em>
Pears, or what the <em>Germans</em> call a <em>Pear-souse</em>.</p>

<p>But, as <cite>Antonius Colmeri de Lodesma</cite> has
given a distinct Account of <em>Chocolate</em>, and
the Method of preparing it, the Reader
may expect that I should say something of
the Use and Method of preparing the Water
of <em>Chavva</em>; and this I shall the more
willingly do, because no Physician, or Botanist,
so far as I know, has expresly, but
only accidentally, and imperfectly, given
the History of the <em>Chavva</em>. But I would
advise Physicians to order the Use, not only
of <em>Chocolate</em>, but also of the <em>Chavva</em>, very
sparingly; though both Liquors are highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
commended by the high and learned, as
well as the low and illiterate Part of Mankind:
For <cite>Hieronymus Benzo</cite>, who, according
to <cite>Dalechampius, Lib. 18. Histor. General.
Plant.</cite> calls it, "A Wash rather fit
for Hogs, than a Liquor proper for human
Creatures." <cite>Benzo</cite>, after residing
above an Year in the Province of <em>Nicariquan</em>,
in <em>America</em>, had, all the while, a mortal
Aversion to this Liquor; till, falling short
of Wine, he learned to imitate the Natives,
that he might not be under a Necessity of
drinking Water perpetually. This Liquor,
by its somewhat bitter Taste, refreshes and
refrigerates the Body, without intoxicating
those who use it. This is the principal and
dearest Commodity of those Countries; nor
do the <em>Indians</em>, who use it, esteem any thing
more highly, according to <cite>Clusius, Lib. 2.
Exot. Cap. 29.</cite> and <cite>Anonym. Auctar.</cite> in <cite>Dodon</cite>.
I must own I should, with <em>Benzo</em>,
have preferred pure Water to this unnatural
Mixture, which, as well as <em>Coffee</em>, and <em>Tea</em>,
the <em>Europeans</em> may very well want, without
any Loss of Health: And it were to be
wished, that the excessive Demands for all
these, did not excite People of sordid Tempers,
to adulterate them, with Substances of
heterogeneous Parts, and such as are unfriendly
to Nature. This, as I have before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
mentioned, with respect to <em>Tobacco</em>, is the
Reason why, in our Age, we are seized with
Disorders, the Names of which are not so
much as mentioned in the Writings of the
Antients. Hence <cite>Bartholin</cite> thinks, "That
Aromatics and Spices, which are no less
the Causes of Wars in <em>Europe</em>, than of
Commotions in the Body, ought to be
prohibited; since the Purposes of Life and
Health will be far better answered, by
cleansing the Blood now and then with
the Leaves of the <em>Coluthea</em>, Water-Cresses,
or <em>Fumitory</em>. We are also to chuse
an Antidote for common Use; but not
the <em>Theriaca</em>, of which the Emperor <cite>Antoninus</cite>
took the Bulk of a Bean every
Morning, nor the <em>Mithridate</em>; for these
are injurious by their Heat, and consequently
improper for us. But we are to
use <em>Conserve of Roses</em>, <em>Rob.</em> of <em>Elder</em>,
Electuaries of <em>Marygolds</em>, the <em>Morus Norvegica</em>,
and other indigenous Plants, whose
Qualities are best suited to our Temperaments
and Constitutions." But the Use of
the Herb <em>Tea</em>, if it could be brought fresh
and recent from <em>China</em> into <em>Europe</em>, would
be more tolerable than that of <em>Chocolate</em>,
and <em>Coffee</em>, which is of all others the worst:
Since a Decoction of the <em>Chavva</em> surprizingly
effeminates both the Minds and Bodies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the <em>Persians</em>; by imitating whom, we shall
never arrive at that Vigour and Hardiness,
which <cite>Julius Cæsar</cite>, and <cite>Cornelius Tacitus</cite>,
so much admired in our Forefathers.</p>

<p>We have before observed, that <cite>Amurath</cite>,
the fourth Emperor of the <em>Turks</em>, under Pain
of Death, totally prohibited the Use of <em>Tobacco</em>,
lest his Subjects should become barren.
But we <em>Europeans</em> heedlesly go on by the Abuse
of <em>Coffee</em>, to emasculate ourselves like the
<em>Persians</em>, who are fond of Sterility, and, according
to <cite>Olearius</cite>, much more salacious
than the <em>Europeans</em>; But of this Effect of
<em>Coffee</em> we shall afterwards treat.</p>

<p>As the Fruit of the <em>Cacao</em>, or <em>Cacarate</em>,
which resemble <em>Almonds</em>, are the Basis of
<em>Chocolate</em>, they are found engraved in <cite>Tabernemontan.
Lib. 3. Cap. 16</cite>. So that I shall
here give no Cuts of them, since I have done
that in <cite>Quadripartit. Botan. Class. 3. No. 11,
12.</cite> when, describing the Seed <em>Bon</em>, or <em>Ban</em>,
which is also called <em>Buna</em>, or <em>Buncho</em>, and
<em>Bunea</em>, or the Seed from which is prepared
the <em>Coava</em>, <em>Caova</em>, <em>Cavve</em>, <em>Choava</em>, and
<em>Cahvve</em>, which, by a Corruption, is, no
doubt, the <em>Coffee</em> of the <em>Europeans</em>.</p>

<p>If it should be asked, to what Class of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Simples, whether that of Herbs, or Trees,
we are to refer the Plant which bears the
Seed <em>Bon</em>, from which the Water of <em>Chavve</em>
is prepared, and which is also mentioned
by <cite>Olearius</cite>, in <cite>Itinerar. Persiæ, Cap. 17</cite>.
I answer, that some, ignorant of <em>Botany</em>,
may take it for an Herb, whose Seeds resemble
those of the <em>Turkish</em> Corn, or the
<em>Indian</em> Corn, by <cite>Bauhine</cite> called <em>Mays</em>, or
for our Wheat: Whereas, it is no Herb,
but a Tree, by <cite>Olearius</cite>, in the last quoted
Passage, described in the following Manner:
"The <em>Persians</em>, in smoaking <em>Tobacco</em>,
have always the black Water of <em>Chavve</em>
present. The Fruit with which they
prepare this Liquor is sent from <em>Egypt</em>;
and, in the inner Side, resembles the
<em>Turkish</em>, though on the outer Side, the
<em>European</em> Wheat. This Fruit is of the
Bigness of a <em>Turkey Bean</em>, and the Shrub
bears a white Flower. The Fruit, or
Berries, they burn, or roast, in a dry Pan;
after which they grind them, and boil them
in Water, which they drink, and which has
a Kind of hot, unpleasant Taste. It is
esteemed a great Cooler; for which Reason
it is drank by most; but if it is used
to Excess, it extinguishes the Inclination
to Venery, and induces Sterility." The
Seed <em>Bon</em>, or <em>Ban</em>, is collected from a Tree
bearing its own Name, if we may believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
<cite>Prosper Alpinus, Lib. de Plant. Egypt. Cap.
16</cite>. This Author, after residing some Years
in <em>Egypt</em>, saw the <em>Bhon-Tree</em> in the Green-House
of <em>Hali Bei</em>, the <em>Turk</em>. An intire
Description and Cut of this Tree is also to
be found in <cite>Tom. 1. Lib. 4. Histor. Plantar.
Univers. Cap. 5.</cite> Since, therefore, <cite>Alpinus</cite>
compares this Tree to our <em>Euonymus</em>, and says,
that the former resembles the latter: Hence
<cite>Caspar Bauhine</cite>, in his <cite>Pinax</cite>, places it among
the Species of <em>Euonymus</em>, and calls it the
<cite>Egyptian Bon, like the Euonymus, with a
Fruit like Bay-Berries, from whose Seeds
the Egyptians make their Liquor, called Coava.</cite>
Though this Fruit, with respect to Figure,
Bark, and Colour, is highly similar to
Bay-Berries, yet it is far less in Bulk. In
my Opinion, it most resembles the Seeds of
the admirable <em>Peruvian</em> Tree, Decoctions of
which, are used by the <em>Eastern</em> Nations, the
<em>Egyptians</em>, <em>Turks</em>, and <em>Persians</em>, for corroborating
a cold Stomach, assisting Concoction,
and removing Obstructions of the <em>Viscera</em>.
They also, with Success, use this Decoction
for many Days against old Obstructions, and
cold Tumors of the Liver and Spleen. This
Decoction, according to <cite>Alpinus</cite>, seems also
appropriated to the <em>Uterus</em>, which it warms,
and frees from Obstructions: Thus, the
<em>Egyptian</em> and <em>Arabian</em> Women, for the due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Evacuation of their <em>Menses</em>, use this Decoction
for several Days after they commence.
Hence, according to <cite>Olearius</cite>, the <em>Persians</em>
are not afraid, lest the Decoction of <em>Cavve</em>
render them cold; unless we should also
say, that <em>Agnus Castus</em> which induces Sterility,
is also of a cold Temperature: But
this Doubt will be cleared by-and-by. It
were to be wished, that the celebrated <cite>Johannes
Weslingius</cite>, who also travelled into
<em>Egypt</em>, had had an Opportunity of seeing
this Tree; since he would have given us a
more accurate Description of it, than we
have hitherto got; for, in <cite>Commentar. in
Prosper. Alpin.</cite> he tells us, that the Fruit of
this Tree is brought from <em>Jamin</em>, or <em>Arabia
Felix</em> into <em>Egypt</em>; and, that a Decoction of
it is sold in some Thousands of Taverns at
<em>Memphis</em>. <cite>Prosper. Alpinus</cite> also, in <cite>Lib. de
Medicina Egyptor. Lib. 4. Cap. 3.</cite> when
treating of the Decoctions used by the <em>Egyptians</em>,
whether sick, or in Health, tells us,
that, in a particular Manner, they make use
of the Decoction called <em>Choava</em>, prepared with
the Coats or Husk of the Seeds called <em>Bon</em>.
Then he describes the Preparation of <em>Bon</em>, by
telling us, that it smells like Corn, Rye, Barley,
or Pease, when thrown upon live Coals,
and burned a little. <cite>Alpinus</cite>, however, endeavors
to evince, that the Seeds of <em>Bon</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
consist of two Substances, the one thick and
earthy, by which they brace up and corroborate,
and the other thin and subtile, by
which they heat, absterge, and remove Obstructions.
That they are highly drying is
certain, but I cannot for this Reason comprehend
why <cite>Prosper Alpinus</cite> asserts, that
Cold prevails moderately in them; for they
act by their whole Substance, both by their
Salt and both Kinds of Sulphur: So that it
is highly probable they produce these Effects,
on account of their ungrateful Taste and
Smell. But it is said these Seeds are corrected
with Sugar. Thus <cite>Weslingius</cite> informs us,
"that some correct the Bitterness of this
Decoction with Sugar, and preserve the
whole Kernel of the Fruit incrustated with
Sugar. Nor is this only customary in
<em>Egypt</em>, but also through all the Provinces
of <em>Persia</em>. This renders the Seeds <em>Bon</em>
not only dear, but scarce, in <em>Europe</em>."
Though <cite>Weslingius</cite> thinks that these Seeds
are useful to the <em>Europeans</em>, yet I am of
a different Opinion; for, in like Manner, the
<em>Europeans</em> have resolved to sweeten, not
only their <em>Coffee</em>, but also their <em>Chocolate</em>
and <em>Tea</em>, without having any View to prevent
Disorders, or recover Health; but only
to follow the Customs of the <em>Asiatics</em>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
indulge themselves in a Liquor, whose Taste
is pleasant to them.</p>

<p>If it should be said, that <cite>Tulpius</cite> informs
us, that the <em>Chinese</em> dissolve a few Grains of
Salt, or Sugar, in their Infusions of <em>Tea</em>, I
answer, we here enquire not what is done, but
what ought to be done; not what is palatable,
but what is conducive to preserve
Health, and restore it when lost. Though
I do not altogether disapprove of <em>Salt</em> in <em>Tea</em>,
yet I absolutely condemn <em>Sugar</em>. How ill
the <em>Europeans</em>, especially those of the <em>Northern</em>
Countries, consult their Health, by mixing
their <em>Mustard</em>, and their Sauces of <em>Vinegar</em>,
and <em>Horse-Radish</em>, designed as a
Preservative against the <em>Scurvy</em>, with <em>Sugar</em>,
I have already shewn, in <cite>Class. 3. Quadripartit.
Botan.</cite> For the same Reason, <em>Sugar</em>,
mixed with an Infusion of <em>Tea</em>, infringes and
impairs its Virtues; so that, by this means,
we drink, not a medicated Water, but little
more only than simple <em>European</em> Water,
edulcorated with <em>Sugar</em>. This, no doubt,
is an excellent Remedy against Intoxication;
but certainly if we read both antient and
modern Authors, we shall find, that Drunkenness
may be removed by drinking cold
Water. Besides, an Intoxication, next to
Madness, may be greatly alleviated by wrapping
up the <em>Scrotum</em> in Cloths dipped in cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Water. Hence we have but little Reason to
bring <em>Tea</em> from <em>China</em>, <em>Tartary</em>, and <em>Japan</em>, at an
extravagant Price, which might be far better
laid out, in relieving poor indigent Families at
Home. But the present <em>Europeans</em> are vastly
different from what they were before the
<em>Asiatic</em> Effeminacy was known among us.
The <em>Europeans</em> might, perhaps, be indulged
in the perpetual Use of <em>Tea</em>, provided their Regimen
was the same with that of the <em>Asiatics</em>.
Now, Regimen includes all the five Non-Naturals,
which are Air, Meat and Drink,
Excretion and Retention, Motion and Rest,
Sleep and Watching, and the Passions of
the Mind. Now, all these, in <em>Europe</em>, are
vastly different from what they are in the
<em>Indies</em>, as is obvious from the faithful and
impartial Accounts, given us by <cite>Martinius</cite>,
and <cite>Mandelslo</cite>. This Subject is excellently
handled by <cite>Hippocrates</cite>, in <cite>Tr. de Aere,
Aquis, &amp; Locis</cite>, who joins these three together,
with great Judgment, and for very
sufficient Reasons; since each of the three
has Atoms, in a manner, peculiar to itself,
which it continually sends forth, and diffuses
even to a great Distance: So that some
Bodies, according to <cite>Bartholine</cite>, may, by
means of the Atoms they emit, propagate
the Sphere of their sympathetic Actions, to
the Distance of a Thousand Miles. About<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the <em>Equinoxes</em>, and <em>Solstices</em>, the sudden
Changes of the State of the <em>Atmosphere</em>,
and the Variety of Vapours exhaled from
the Earth, produce surprizing Alterations in
Health. And these Exhalations rise sometimes
in such large Quantities, as to be condensed,
and by their own Weight to fall
down, in the Form of sulphureous Showers:
A memorable Instance of this we had in
<em>Norway</em>, where, on <em>May 19, 1665</em>, a violent
Tempest, accompanied with uncommon
Thunder, and thick Clouds, broke out:
During this Storm, there fell from the
Clouds, a Substance, highly similar to Sulphur,
which not only floated on the Water,
but also seemed to cover the Earth.
When <cite>Stobæus</cite> subjected this Matter to an Examination,
he found, after drying, and passing
it through a Sieve, that when it was become
moderately warm, on an heated Tile, it
emitted a fetid Smoak of the same Colour
with that of the Spirit of <em>Nitre</em>, in Distillation.
But this Matter could not be fused
by the strongest Fire; by which Means,
however, it became inodorous, and like
small Sand, though before it resembled a
fetid, coarse Sulphur, reduced to Powder.
The same Author, in his Letters also, informs
me, that, when about as much of the recent
Matter, as would lie on the Point of a Knife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
was laid upon a red hot Tile, it was spontaneously
kindled, made a Kind of Noise,
and emitted a reddish fetid Smoak. Next
Day <cite>Stobæus</cite> endeavoured to sublime this
crude and sulphureous Matter, by itself, without
any Addition, in order to discover,
whether Flowers of Sulphur could be obtained
from it; but his Labour was in vain; for
though the Matter became red hot by due
Degrees of Fire, yet no Flowers appeared;
only the first Steam, which, in the
Alembic, appeared reddish, in the Water,
assumed a dark ferruginous Colour: Then,
by augmenting the Fire, a whitish Spirit appeared,
which gave a similar Colour to the
Water. This Steam and Spirit appeared in
Distillation to be of an acrid Taste; so that
<cite>Stobæus</cite> justly concluded them to contain a volatile
Salt, of a particular Kind. The same Author
informs me, in his Letter, that the Rain
which fell, during the Thunder, smelled of
Sulphur: And from this Observation, he
thinks, the Chemists Doctrine, concerning
the Generation of Thunder, may be
confirmed. As every Substance does not
act upon every other Substance, nor sulphureous
Things on those of the same
Nature, he put this Matter into Spirit of
<em>Turpentine</em>, and digested it by a gentle
Fire; by which Means, it gave the Liquor a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
a yellowish Colour, and a Smell, very like
that of Balsam of <em>Sulphur</em>: But of these I
shall not treat at greater Length, since I
am perswaded that Miracles have ceased, and
that Providence disposes of second Causes according
to wise and stated Laws. Hence it is,
that about the <em>Vernal</em> and <em>Autumnal Equinoxes</em>,
or <em>Solstices</em>, all Sorts of Diseases, and especially
those of the endemial or epidemical Kind,
rage; such as the <em>Scurvy</em>, <em>Measles</em>, and <em>Small-Pox</em>,
as also the <em>Plague</em>, though often these Disorders
are confined to one City. A memorable
Instance of this, we have in the Cities
of <em>Hambourg</em> and <em>Amsterdam</em>, which, in 1663,
and 1664, were afflicted with a Pestilence,
which, however, did not spread itself to
<em>Denmark</em>, <em>Sweden</em>, <em>Britain</em>, <em>France</em>, and
<em>Germany</em>. But, as the <em>Plague</em> is imported
from <em>Africa</em>, it is probable, that the Salubrity
of the Atmosphere, in those Countries which
escaped, checked the sulphureous, saline, and
pestilential Atoms, which first contaminated
the Air of <em>Amsterdam</em>, and then that of
<em>Hambourg</em>. But all Countries differ so widely,
with respect to Air, Water, and Situation,
that none of them, even the most
contiguous, are exactly alike, and conspire
in producing the same Effects. Thus,
among the <em>German</em> Wines, the <em>Rhenish</em> is
the best; though it also differs in Good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>ness,
according to the particular Parts in
which it is produced. The like holds in
the <em>French</em> Wine, the worst of which is
reckoned that of <em>Orleans</em>; for which Reason,
<cite>Quercean</cite>, in his <cite>Diæticum, Cap. 6.</cite>
tells us, "That in the Oeconomy of the
King of <em>France</em>'s House, it is enacted,
by a domestic Law, that the Steward
shall give the King no <em>Orleans</em> Wines;"
which, however, has a very grateful Taste.
The same holds, not only in Ales, but also
in other Things: Thus, the <em>Noremberg</em>
Cakes, on account of the peculiar Qualities
of the Water with which the Meal and
Aromatics are made up, are far better, and
more pleasant to the Taste, than those prepared
in the same Manner, in any Part of
<em>Europe</em>. This is what the Philosophers have
been at so much Pains to account for. The
Air, Water, and Situation, also constitute
the Reason, why <em>Tea</em> in <em>Europe</em> does not
produce the same Effects it does among the
<em>Asiatics</em>, especially the <em>Chinese</em>. Many Persons
of Rank and Distinction have informed
me, that they could never be sensible of the
so-much-extolled Virtues of <em>Tea</em>, nor perceive
that it prevented Sleep, or rendered
them more brisk, and fit for Business. One
or two Persons, however, subject to Catarrhs,
have confessed to me, that they have become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
far better by the long Use of <em>Tea</em>. Thus,
I have heard, that a certain Ambassador
to the <em>Dutch</em>, who before laboured under
a Difficulty of Hearing, had his Disorder
totally removed, by the large Quantities of
<em>Tea</em> he drank at the <em>Hague</em>. I, myself, have
found <em>Tea</em> to be diuretic. I own, two or
three Persons who have travelled, not only
through <em>Europe</em>, but also through the <em>East
Indies</em>, have affirmed to me, that in <em>Japan</em>,
the drinking of <em>Tea</em> infallibly removes Intoxication,
and prevents Sleep; but this Effect
is not at all produced by it in <em>Europe</em>.
Thus, I have been informed, that Strangers,
upon their Arrival in <em>Muscovy</em>, can drink
such large Quantities of <em>Brandy</em>, as would
put an End to their Lives in other Countries.
Thus, it may happen, that the <em>Chinese</em>,
or <em>Japonese Tea</em>, with the Assistance
and Concurrence of other Things, may produce
a particular Effect, which <em>Tea</em> will not
do in <em>Europe</em>. But all these Effects are produced
by <em>Betony</em>, an Herb universally known
in <em>Europe</em>: Thus, it is certain, that our <em>Chamelæagnus</em>
is the <em>Tea</em> of the <em>Chinese</em>, or <em>Japonese</em>.
But to illustrate my Subject the better,
I shall make a few Remarks on the peculiar
Genius, Regimen, and Method of living
used among the <em>Indians</em> and <em>Chinese</em>. The
<em>Indians</em> then are fond of moistening Aliments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
which guard against the Heat of the Sun;
such as Cherries, Fruits of all Kinds, Pot-Herbs,
Fishes, Oysters, Crabs: Besides, <cite>Michael
Boym</cite>, a learned Jesuit, in his Flora
Sinensis, mentions various Fruits which are
not produced in <em>Europe</em>; whereas Nature
has furnished the <em>Chinese</em> with others, either
like to, or exactly the same with, those of the
<em>Europeans</em>. The former of these, and the other
similar Delicacies of the <em>East Indies</em>, do, in
all Probability, give rise to new Diseases in
<em>Europe</em>. This Jesuit speaks of <em>China</em> in the
following Manner: "The Kingdom of
<em>China</em> is, as it were, a Compound of the
whole Globe, or rather, a Gem, in which
more Riches are to be found than in all
the rest of the World besides. In the
<em>Southerly</em> Parts of the Country, the Heats
are most intense, and produce large Quantities
of all the <em>Indian</em> Fruits, such as
Dates, Mangas, Ananas, and others:
Whereas the <em>Northern</em> Parts produce Figs,
Chesnuts, Nuts of all Kinds, Peaches,
Apricots, and Pears of various Kinds."
Thus provident Nature has furnished the
<em>Southermost</em> Parts of <em>China</em> with Fruits intirely
unknown to the <em>Europeans</em>; whereas,
the <em>Northern</em> Parts produce such as are
known in <em>Europe</em>, and suited to its Soil and
Climate: Since, in the former, the Heats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
are very intense, but not so in the latter.
Thus Nature seems to have prohibited us the
Use of the former of these Fruits, by placing
us at such a Distance from them, and to have
indulged us in the Use of the latter, by placing
us so near them; for the Precept, of
sometimes using Things to which we are
not habituated, does not hold in this Case:
Since, being <em>Europeans</em>, we ought to use the
Regimen, Aliments, and Drinks, peculiar to
<em>Europe</em>; for it is no less generally than justly
observed, that the natural Produce of any
Country is best suited to the Constitution of
its Inhabitants. Thus <em>Tea</em> seems by Nature
adapted to the Inhabitants of <em>China</em>, <em>Coffee</em>
to those of <em>Persia</em>, <em>Chocolate</em> to those of
<em>America</em>, and <em>Ale</em> and <em>Wine</em> to those of the
different Parts of <em>Europe</em>. Thus the antient
Inhabitants of <em>Saxony</em> and <em>Megapolis</em>, before
they became fond of foreign Delicacies, used
to say proverbially, <cite>Drink Wine, and reap
Benefit from it; drink Ale, and become fat;
drink Water, and die.</cite> It is also certain, that
in former Times, the Inhabitants of <em>Iceland</em>
and <em>Norway</em>, when they used a simple Regimen,
and were Strangers to foreign Luxury,
enjoyed good Health to an incredible
Age; whereas, their Posterity are not only
weaker, but hardly live beyond the thirtieth,
fortieth, or fiftieth Year of their Age: So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
that the <em>Lyric</em> Poet seems to have made a
just Prophecy of our own Generation, in the
following Lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Damnosa quid non imminuit dies?</div>
      <div class="verse">Ætas Parentum pejor avis; tulit.</div>
      <div class="verse">Nos nequiores, mox daturos</div>
      <div class="verse">Progeniem Vitiosorem.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><em>Europeans</em> then must have their Constitutions
impaired, and their Strength exhausted,
by living like the Inhabitants of
<em>Asia</em>, <em>Africa</em>, and <em>America</em>; especially since
<cite>Macrobius</cite>, in <cite>Lib. 7, Saturnal. Cap. 4.</cite>
shews, that the most simple Aliments are
the most salutary, and easily digested. Besides,
<cite>Socrates</cite> ordered his Pupils to abstain
from such Meats and Drinks as created an
Appetite after Hunger and Thirst were satisfied.
But, according to the <em>Chinese</em>, <em>Tea</em>
produces an Appetite after Hunger and Thirst
are satisfied; therefore the drinking of it is
to be abstained from. The same holds true
with respect to <em>Chocolate</em>, and <em>Coffee</em>. But
I return to the <em>Chinese</em>, who are accustomed
to Water-drinking, and a frugal Life. Hence,
their Physicians, whom <cite>Martinius</cite>, in the
Preface of his <cite>Atlas Sinicus</cite>, seems to prefer
to those of <em>Europe</em>, no doubt, enjoin
them the Use of <em>Tea</em>, in order to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the Generation of excrementitious Humours;
or, when generated, to carry them off by
Stool, or Urine; for, it is certain, from what
has hitherto been said, that <em>Tea</em> is moderately
heating, bitter, drying, and astringent.
If it should, for these Reasons, be said, that
<em>Tea</em> is justly to be commended for a Weakness
of the Stomach, I answer with <cite>Celsus</cite>,
in <cite>Lib. 1. Cap. 8.</cite> "Our Countrymen ought
not to be believed, who, when indisposed,
covet Wine, or Water, and instead
of charging their own Luxury, lay
the Fault on the Stomach, which has no
Share in it." This Passage is equally
applicable to <em>Tea</em>, <em>Coffee</em>, and <em>Chocolate</em>, and
seems to insinuate, that such Persons, in order
to satiate their Thirst, falsly accuse their
Stomachs. If this were more carefully adverted
to by the Patrons of the <em>Chinese</em> Delicacies,
and especially those who look upon
<em>Tea</em> as a <em>Panacea</em>, they would use it more
sparingly, especially in a bad State of Health;
because <cite>Celsus</cite>, in <cite>Chap. 3.</cite> of the same Book,
tells us, "That Changes ought to be gradually
and slowly made; since that to
which the Patient is not accustomed,
proves, hurtful, whether it be soft, or
hard".</p>

<p>But the <em>Chinese</em> Method of using <em>Tea</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
is not agreeable to the Custom of the <em>Europeans</em>,
and therefore hurtful to them.</p>

<p>Hence the <em>Germans</em>, <em>Saxons</em>, and Inhabitants
of other Nations, in the <em>Baltick</em> Sea,
being neither accustomed to much Wine, nor
to dilute it with Water, are generally seized
with malignant Fevers, when they go into
<em>France</em>, or <em>Italy</em>; because every fixed Substance
fixes such as is volatile; whereas,
such as is volatile, resolves that which is
fixed. Hence the thick and f&oelig;culent Blood
of the <em>Germans</em>, consisting of saline, sulphureous,
fixed, and volatile Parts, and being
changed by the Regimen of <em>France</em>, and
the Heat of the Sun, is subtilized by the
<em>Tartar</em> and <em>Sulphur</em> of the <em>French</em> Wine, especially
in such <em>Germans</em> as took great Care
of their Health, when in their own Country;
and in those who enjoyed good Health,
their Blood is not only subtilized, but also
ferments, undergoes an Ebullition, and is
despumated. Hence arise Spots of different
Colours, produced by the Blood variously
corrupted. But these I have considered more
fully in my <cite>Digressio de Febribus Malignis</cite>.
This Doctrine is warmly inculcated by
<cite>Hippocrates</cite>, who, in <cite>Lib. de Fract. Senectut.
§. 6.</cite> tells us, "That the Age and Constitution
of one Person, differ widely from those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
of another." But this Assertion, how
true soever, is but little adverted to by most
of the <em>Europeans</em>. But I think it incumbent
upon me, for the Reasons now alledged,
to warn them against the Abuse of
<em>Tea</em>; especially since we find, that this Herb
does, by no means, answer the Encomiums
bestowed upon it by the <em>Chinese</em> and <em>Japonese</em>.
I own <em>Tea</em> is of a more drying Quality
than many <em>European</em> Herbs; but, for
this very Reason, the constant Use of it is
so far from procuring Longevity, especially
in Persons of a middling Age, that it rather
accelerates old Age; which, according to
<cite>Macrobius</cite>, in <cite>Lib. 7. Saturn. Cap. 11.</cite> is,
"an Exhaustion and Dissipation of the
vital Liquor, by Length of Time; for
old Age is dry, for Want of natural Moisture,
and sometimes moist through a
Redundance of peccant Humours, produced
by Coldness of Constitution."
Since then <em>Tea</em>, by Means of the Sulphur
it contains, is of a more heating and drying
Nature than <em>Ginger</em>, <em>Cinnamon</em>, <em>Pepper</em>, <em>Cubebs</em>,
<em>Cardamomis</em>, or <em>Arabian Castus</em>; hence,
it necessarily follows, that it is injurious to
old Persons, and such as are of a dry Constitution,
and loose Texture of the solid
Parts. On account of this dry Constitution,
and natural <em>Marasmus</em> of old People,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
which no Art can prevent, they become
thirsty, and more addicted to tippling, than
in their younger Years: Hence arises the
<em>German</em> Proverb, <cite>If a young Man knew the
Pleasure of drinking in old Age, he would be
saving in his younger Years.</cite></p>

<p>It is not, therefore, the native Heat, but
that fatal Dryness which renders the Members
cold, and the Skin corrugated, which
renders old Persons fond of drinking; and for
this Reason, I have, in my <cite>Commentaries</cite>,
universally commended a moistening Diet
for them. Hence, the Inhabitants of those
Nations, who, besides <em>Tea</em>, daily drink Wine,
ought carefully to guard against all sudden
Changes in Diet and Regimen. Thus,
when a certain celebrated <em>French</em> Physician,
endeavoured to perswade a Person of eminent
Rank, who was, generally, twice or thrice a
Year seized with a Catarrh, to change his
Regimen, and give over the Use of Wine, or,
at least, dilute it with Water; because, in
all Probability, the Physician told him, that
cold Water powerfully corrected acrid Humours.
Upon this, the Person of Distinction
asked the Physician, whether he was
in good Health? To whom the Physician
replied he was: Then, says he, continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
to drink Water, or Wine and Water, till
you can drink no more; but you shall never,
on account of slight Catarrhs, which
are rarely offensive to me, perswade me to
accept of a <em>French</em>, or <em>Italian</em> Regimen, instead
of a <em>Danish</em>, and <em>German</em>: Nor will
I drink Water instead of Wine, or Ale. I
am at present full of Flesh and Blood, and
enjoy a good Appetite: My Forefathers, for
many Years back, were of the like Constitution,
and used the same Regimen I do;
but if, in the sixtieth Year of my Age, I
should begin to drink Water, I am afraid
I should rather resemble you than them;
for you, who are a Water-drinker, though
you enjoy good Health, yet you are emaciated,
have a cadaverous Countenance, and
seem to be rather a Skeleton than a living
Person. I wish all Persons, especially such
as are old, would follow the Example of
this Gentleman, and obstinately reject <em>Tea</em>,
which so dries the Bodies of the <em>Chinese</em>,
that they can hardly spit. It is also an
egregious Mistake, not only among the <em>Persians</em>,
but also among most other Nations,
to think that the Seed <em>Bon</em>, or <em>Ban</em>, which
when toasted is called <em>Coffee</em>, and which I
have taken Care to have engraved in the
Plate after the History of <cite>Scurvy-Grass,
No. 11, 12.</cite> of my <cite>Quadripartitium</cite>, is of so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
cooling a Quality, as to produce Impotence,
even in those who use it frequently; for it
only dries them. Thus <em>Casmin</em>, the Wife
of Sultan <em>Mahmud</em>, after her Husband had
so weakened himself by the Use of <em>Coffee</em>,
that he had been impotent for many Years,
is said, when she saw the Preparations making,
for gelding a generous <em>Persian</em> Steed,
to have told the Persons employed in that
Work, that there was no Occasion for so
much Trouble, since, by giving the Horse
<em>Coffee</em>, he would become like her Husband,
the King. This Story is, with the same Circumstances,
related by <cite>Olearius</cite>, in his Travels
through <em>Muscovy</em> and <em>Persia</em>. <em>Coffee</em>,
then produces Sterility in the <em>Persians</em>, not
because it is cold, but because it gradually
dries their Bodies, by means of a certain
Sulphur, as peculiar to itself, as those of
<em>Opium</em>, <em>Tobacco</em>, or <em>Agnus Castus</em> are to them.
As the <em>Agnus Castus</em>, or <em>Vitex</em> is, by <cite>Galen</cite>,
said to be dry in the third Degree, like <em>Rue</em>,
and to consist of very subtile Parts, it is
impossible it should produce Impotence by
rendering the Seed cold, which it diminishes
and dissipates, not so much by the Subtilty
of its Parts, as by its peculiar Sulphur.
The incomparable <cite>Hoffman</cite>, both in his
<cite>Variæ Lectiones</cite>, and in his Treatise <cite>de
Medicamentis Officinalibus</cite>, has treated accu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>rately
of the <em>Vitex</em>. But, if that Author had
been still alive, he would have agreed with
me in this, that what <cite>Galen</cite> ascribes to the
Subtilty of the Parts, not only of all Simples,
but also of such Things as act by their
whole Substance, such as <em>Opium</em>, <em>Tobacco</em>,
<em>Agnus Castus</em>, <em>Chinese Tea</em>, <em>European Tea</em>, or
the <em>Myrtus Brabantica</em>, or the <em>Chamelæagnus
Danica</em>, is to be ascribed to their small
sulphureous, and excessively dry Parts. Thus
the Seeds of the <em>Agnus Castus</em> affect the Head,
and from what has been said, it is sufficiently
obvious, that the Seeds of the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>
contribute principally to intoxicate the Country
People, who prepare their Ale with it:
The Seeds of the <em>Agnus Castus</em>, according to
<cite>Hoffman</cite>, "do not convey Flatulences to
the Head, except when they affect it by
the Subtilty of their Parts (which I call
their sulphureous Quality) just as Wine,
whose Taste and Smell they have, according
to <cite>Pliny</cite>, affects the Head, and procures
Sleep." All these Properties of
Wine, as well as of our <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, proceed
from their Sulphur, which is grateful
to the Nerves: But these Effects could never
be produced, only by <cite>Galen</cite>'s Subtilty of
the Parts. But to proceed, in the Words
of <cite>Hoffman</cite>: "Another Proof of the Subtilty
of the Parts of <em>Agnus Castus</em>, (which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
I call its sulphureous Quality) is, that
its Seeds, whether crude, or toasted,
discuss Flatulencies of the Intestines, and
most powerfully when toasted; since these
do not so much affect the Head as the
former." Thus, it also happens, that an
Account of the artificial and careful Toasting
of the <em>Chinese Tea</em>, by which most of
its sulphureous Parts are dissipated, it prevents
Sleep in the <em>Chinese</em>: Whereas, the
<em>European Tea</em>, or <em>Chamelæagnus</em>, renders the
Country People, as it were, intoxicated, and
disposed to Sleep. But these different Effects
are not owing to any occult Qualities
of the <em>Chinese</em> and <em>European Teas</em>, but manifestly
to the sulphureous Parts, of which
the <em>Chinese</em> has a far smaller Quantity than
our <em>Chamelæagnus</em>. Thus, it is certain, that
prepared <em>Vipers</em> may be safely eaten, and
that <cite>Dioscorides</cite> roasted <em>Vipers</em> for Food;
so vast a Difference there is between artificial
Preparations, and natural Productions.
But to proceed: <cite>Hoffman</cite>, with respect to
toasting the Seeds of the <em>Agnus Castus</em>, tells
us, "That in toasting, the remarkably subtile
Parts are dissipated." These remarkably
subtile Parts, I call sulphureous, which
the <em>Persians</em> also dissipate, by an artificial
toasting, from the Seeds <em>Bon</em>, or <em>Ban</em>, conveyed
to them from <em>Egypt</em>. Thus, the ce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>lebrated
<cite>Hoffman</cite>, only differs from me in
Words, but not in Sentiments. The same
also holds true of <em>Chocolate</em>. I, therefore,
conclude, that all these Substances are of a
drying Quality, on account of their sulphureous
Parts. I would, therefore, advise all
<em>Europeans</em> to have a due Regard to these
Things, to preserve Youth by moistening
Substances, and prevent old Age, which is
brought on before its due Time, by Means
of these drying and sulphureous Commodities;
though, at the same time, I do not
prohibit the Use of moderately hot Substances.
Let no one condemn me for making
Repetitions; since it is a Maxim, not
only of Policy, but also of common
Humanity, <cite>That the Safety of the People,
is, of all other Laws, the most essential and
important.</cite> If, therefore, an immense Reward
was bestowed on the Man who preserved
a single <em>Roman</em> Citizen, I may, certainly,
hope for Indulgence, when, by repeated
Expostulations, I attempt to preserve
all <em>Europe</em>, by perswading its Inhabitants not to
exchange our own salutary Regimen, for that
of the <em>Asiatics</em>, and <em>Chinese</em>, by following their
Custom of <em>Tea</em>-Drinking. <cite>Martinus Martinius</cite>,
indeed, in his Preface to his <cite>Atlas
Siniticus</cite>, greatly extols the <em>Chinese</em> Regimen,
in the following Manner: "Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Drinks, says he, whether prepared with
Water, Wine, or Rice, must always be
warm; they macerate their <em>Tea</em> in particular
in boiling Water, which they drink
as hot as they can bear. When I was
accustomed to this Regimen, I commended
the <em>Chinese</em>, and condemned the
<em>Europeans</em>, who are so fond of drinking
cold Liquors; for, in <em>China</em>, the Inhabitants,
by drinking their Liquors warm,
both extinguish Thirst, and so dissipate
the redundant Humours, that they hardly
ever spit; nor are they afflicted with Crudities
of the Stomach, as the <em>Europeans</em>
are: They have also fewer, and less violent
Diseases; neither are the Stone, the
Gout in the Hands and Feet, and other
similar Disorders, known among them."
But these Things happened to <cite>Martinius</cite>,
in <em>China</em>, and not in <em>Europe</em>. Nor shall
he ever perswade me, to change the <em>European</em>,
for the <em>Indian</em> Regimen. Since, according
to <cite>Martinius</cite> himself, some of the
Inhabitants of that Country, on account of
the <cite>Pythagorean</cite> Doctrine, of the Transmigration
of Souls, religiously abstain from
Flesh, and think,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>----<cite>Scelus est in Viscere Viscera Condi,
Congestoq; Avidum pinguescere Corpore
Corpus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Alterusq; Animantem Animantis vivero
Letho.</cite></p></div>

<p><cite>Martinius</cite>, therefore, makes an insufficient
Enumeration of Causes; since the
good Health of the <em>Chinese</em>, is not totally
owing to the Use of <em>Tea</em>, but to various
other Circumstances, which we shall not
here enumerate: Only I shall, from the
<cite>Amphiatridius</cite> of <cite>Johannes Boterius</cite>, published
in 1600, observe, "That in the
various Districts of <em>China</em>, the Clemency
and Salubrity of the Air is so great, that
a Pestilence has never been remembered
to rage universally in them." For the
Sake also of those who want the sixth Part
of the <cite>Theatrum Europæum Johannis Bleau</cite>,
or the <cite>Novus Atlas Martinii</cite>, I shall, from
the Preface of the last-mentioned Author,
take the following Passage: "In Practice,
the <em>Chinese</em> Physicians surpass those of
<em>Europe</em>, who are more addicted to Dispute
and Speculation, but less successful
and happy in the Cure of Diseases, than
the former." But, if a <em>Chinese</em> Physician
was to practice on the <em>Baltick</em> Shore, where
endemial <em>Scurvys</em> rage, it is hardly credible,
that he would cure them with greater Success,
than a skilful <em>European</em> Physician does;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
since, according to <cite>Hippocrates</cite>, there are
many nominal, but few real Physicians.
The same Author, in his <cite>Prisca Medicina</cite>,
informs us, "That most Physicians resemble
bad Pilots, who, if they steer the
Vessel in a smooth and calm Sea, can
prevent the Detection of their Ignorance;
but, when they are attacked by blowing
Winds, and violent Tempests, it becomes
sufficiently obvious, that the Ship must
be lost through their Fault, and Want of
Skill." But to drop the Defence of the
<em>European</em> Physicians, I shall return to the
<em>Asiatics</em>. <cite>Martinius</cite> then, in the Passage
last quoted, tells us, "That the <em>Chinese</em>
Physicians generally prepare their Medicines
of Simples and Decoctions; that
they use Unctions, and Frictions, but not
Venesections, which they look upon as an
irreparable Error. They rather chuse to
reduce the Blood to a due Temperature,
by Fasting, and refrigerating Medicines;
for, say they, because Broth boils in a
Pot, the Broth is not, therefore, to be
poured out, but the Fire to be removed
from the Pot." But this Comparison is
certainly far from being just: And, a little
after, the Author subjoins, "In <em>China</em> are great
Numbers of Chymists, who confidently
boast of producing Gold, and prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>ing
Death by Means of their Medicines.
The Design of these Men is like that
of their Brethren in <em>Europe</em>, to extort
Money from the credulous and avaritious
Part of their Fellow Creatures."</p>

<p>I now return, to consider the Air, Water,
and Situation of the <em>Chinese</em>. <cite>Martinius</cite>
then, in the Place before quoted, tells
us, that <em>China</em>, or the most remote Parts of
<em>Asia</em>, abounds with all Kinds of metallic
Mines, such as those of Gold, Silver, Mercury,
Iron, Tin, Copper, Minium, <em>Lapis
Lazuli</em>, and Vitriol; in consequence of
which, it is probable, that the <em>Chinese</em> Waters,
flowing from the Mountains, as well as
those of <em>Europe</em>, partake of the Qualities of
the various Minerals through which they
glide. Thus, according to <cite>Georgius Agricola</cite>,
in <cite>Lib. 10. de Natur. Fossil. Cap. 18.</cite>
at <em>Goslar</em>, in <em>Saxony</em>, there is a Kind of
Bole, or Earth, impregnated with the Juice
of <em>Vitriol</em>, as also with <em>Oker</em>. The same
<cite>Agricola</cite>, in <cite>Lib. 1. De Natura eorum quæ
ex Terra effluunt. Cap. 4.</cite> informs us, that
the River <em>Ochra</em>, receives its Name from
<em>Oker</em>, with which it is tinged, of a yellow
Colour, at the Place where a Rivulet coming
from Mount <em>Ramelus</em>, disembogues itself
into it. Hence, it is easy to assign a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Reason, why the <em>Goslar</em> Ale is so diuretic:
The <em>Garlabian</em> Ale also, so much used at
<em>Helmstadt</em>, is of a medicinal Nature: Hence,
according to the celebrated <cite>Hoffman</cite>, in <cite>Paral.
Officin. Cap. ult.</cite> "It both cures and
produces Diseases in such as are not accustomed
to it; for it is prepared of some
hot, mineral Water, as is obvious from
its peculiar Taste. On the contrary, the
<em>Turgensian</em> Ale is highly agreeable; because
the Water of which it is prepared
has some mineral Quality, which is easily
lost by Carriage; which also happens to
other Waters. Hence, <cite>Augustus</cite>, Elector of
<em>Leipsic</em>, in preparing his Ale, instead of
<em>Malt</em>, ordered only a Drag to be boiled."
I would not, however, have any one confide
too much, either in hot or cold Mineral
Waters. But among Mineral Waters, I also
reckon that described by <cite>Martinius</cite>, in his
Account of the ninth Province of <em>China</em>,
called <em>Kiangnar</em>, and the fifth Town, called
<em>Chang-chew</em>, in the following Manner:
"Near <em>Kiangin</em> is a Mount, called Mount
<em>Chin</em>, celebrated on account of a fabulous
<em>Chinese</em> Story; for they assert, that a Woman
was there born of a <em>Deer</em>. The
Rivulet <em>Leang</em>, from a small Hill, called
<em>Hoej</em>, flows into a Lake, near <em>Vusie</em>:
Its Origin is a Fountain called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
<em>Hoej</em>, whose Waters are, by the Natives,
accounted to be the second in Goodness;
and I myself am convinced from
Experience, that the <em>Chinese</em> are in the
right, with respect to these Waters; for
they are universally admired by the Grandees;
and hardly any Ship passes, without
purchasing, for a Trifle, large Quantities
of this Water, previously put up in
Casks; though Strangers, who stay for
any Time there, may, for nothing, drink
as much as they please. It is conveyed
to the most remote Provinces, even as far
as <em>Peking</em>; for it is excellently well suited
to the Preparation of <em>Tea</em>: So that these
two Commodities are generally sold together."
But surely this <em>Chinese</em> Water is
to be had in no Part of <em>Europe</em>. The same
Author, in his Description of the fifteenth
Province, called <em>Junnam</em>, and its Metropolis,
tells us, "That in Mount <em>Xang</em>, situated
to the <em>North</em> of the Town, there
is a Spring of intensely cold Water, which,
however, is highly beneficial to paralitic
Persons." He also tells us, that in the
same Province, there is a Spring called <em>Hiangkui</em>,
which, in their Language, signifies
odoriferous Water, "Because it diffuses a
fragrant Scent, especially in the <em>Spring</em>, at
which Time, the Inhabitants offer Sacri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>fices
to the Fountain, and drink Water,
mixed with Wine, or with a Liquor prepared
of <em>Rice</em>. They also assert, that this
Liquor cures many Diseases." That these
Waters are impregnated with Metallic Particles,
I have two Reasons to believe: First,
Because <cite>Martinius</cite> informs us, that the Rivulet
near the City <em>Vusie</em>, flows from a Fountain
on a little Hill, called <em>Hoej</em>: The second
is, that the Waters of this Lake are
conveyed to the remotest Provinces, even
to the Royal City, <em>Peking</em>, where they are
used by the Grandees in preparing their
<em>Tea</em>. But the best Waters, when taken
from the <em>Spring</em>, cannot be long preserved
from Corruption, unless they abound with
a peculiar Salt: Since the cold Mineral Waters
of the <em>Spaw</em>, lose much of their Virtue
by being conveyed only into the Provinces
adjacent to <em>Germany</em>. Thus, it is sufficiently
known to all the <em>Europeans</em>, that the <em>May</em>
Rains abound with Salt and Sulphur; in
consequence of which, they keep longer
free from Corruption than other Waters.
For this Reason, it is customary among the
<em>Papists</em>, to prepare their <em>Holy Water</em> of <em>May</em>
Rain: See my <cite>Digressio de Febribus Malignis</cite>.
But, lest these Reasons should be
esteemed conjectural, I shall farther prove,
and confirm my Opinion from <cite>Martinius</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
who, in the Place before quoted, speaks in
the following Manner: "It is not without
Reason that the City <em>Gnihing</em> receives
that <em>Name</em>, which, in their Language,
signifies the <em>Glory of the Earth</em>;
and which was bestowed upon it, because
in it are made the earthen Vessels,
used in diluting, and drinking their <em>Tea</em>.
The Reason why these are preferred to
the <em>Chinese</em>, though more transparent,
and diaphanous, is, because the former
convey to the <em>Tea</em>, a certain Taste and
Smell, much admired by the <em>Chinese</em>;
so that the Inhabitants of that City are
much employed in making them; and
some of them are sold at a Price equal,
if not superior, to those of <em>Portugal</em>."
Since, therefore, these Vessels communicate
to the <em>Tea</em>, both a Smell and Taste, which
are grateful to the <em>Chinese</em>; since the Cause
of Taste is a volatile Salt, and that of
Smell a certain Sulphur; since this Salt
and Sulphur can hardly be separated by Chymistry;
and since it is peculiar to Salt to
penetrate into the Essence of Things; it
must necessarily happen, that the Water,
taken from the Lake, or River last mentioned,
and which is without any Smell,
(for, if it had been odorous, <cite>Martinius</cite>
would have mentioned that Circumstance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
as he did of the third Fountain) must gradually
extract the Taste and Smell from
those precious Vessels, resembling <em>Lemnian</em>
or <em>Silesian</em> Earth. But this Water of the
Rivulet <em>Leang</em>, or of the Fountain <em>Hoej</em>,
would either not at all, or with Difficulty,
extract the Taste and Smell from these
earthen Vessels, unless it abounded with an
highly penetrating Salt, or, perhaps, a Vitriol;
since <cite>Martinius</cite> tells us, that Vitriol Mines
are found in <em>China</em>, for no Substance can
communicate to another, a Quality which
it does possess itself. <em>Tea</em> has indeed a Taste,
though not of the grateful Kind, as is obvious
from what has been said. The Taste
and Smell, therefore, which the <em>Chinese</em> perceive
in drinking <em>Tea</em>, do not proceed from
the <em>Tea</em> itself, but from the Water, or earthen
Vessels they use, or from both; from the
Water, which by its Mineral Salt, extracts
from the Vessels their Salt and Sulphur;
and from the Vessels, which in return communicate
these to the Water. For this peculiar
Quality of the Earth, the City is called
<em>Gnihing</em>, which, according to <cite>Martinius</cite>,
signifies the <em>Glory of the Earth</em>. It is, by
no means, surprizing to find various fragrant
Mineral Earths: Thus, in the Dutchy of
<em>Kalenberg</em>, in <em>Germany</em>, there is dug up a
certain bituminous Mineral, which is a Kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of intermediate Substance, between Earth,
Clay, and Stone; and which if it is either
licked with the Tongue, or has cold Water,
and especially Rain-Water, poured upon
it, diffuses a Smell as fragrant as that of
the Violet: The Truth of this, I know
from Experience. But these precious Vessels
are so rare in <em>Europe</em>, that the smallest
of them are not to be purchased under an
immense Sum. When, however, I understood,
that <em>Frederic</em> the third, King of <em>Norway</em>
and <em>Denmark</em>, had, among other <em>Chinese</em>
Curiosities, two of these elegant and
sumptuous Vessels; I obtained the Use of
them from him, and prevailed upon <cite>Julius
Reichelt</cite>, Professor of Mathematics at
<em>Strasburg</em>, and a skilful Designer, to delineate
them. This Gentleman has, with the
greatest Accuracy, not only exhibited in the
following Plates, these, and other <em>Chinese</em>
Utensils, but also informed himself of their
real Bulk, with all the Care and Pains he
possibly could: But we shall give an Account
of his Performance in his own Words:</p>

<p>"At the Request of the learned and judicious

some of the <em>Chinese</em> Utensils, and hope for
Indulgence, because these Vessels are neither

used by Mechanics, since I thought
it expedient, both for the Sake of the
Subject, and the Satisfaction of the curious
Reader, to have a due Regard to
Capacity, and Measure. I have exhibited
the Orthography of the Vessel represented
by <i>Fig.</i> IX. the Scenography
of <i>Fig.</i> III. of which the Orthography is
represented by <i>Fig.</i> IV. In <i>Fig.</i> VIII. the
Scenography of the Vessel M, and the
Orthography of its Cover N, are represented;
but I have only described the
Scenographies of all the rest. I have
used the <em>Rhinlandian</em> Geometrical Foot,
to the Measure of which all the Parts of
these Vessels are adjusted, in that Proportion,
observable in <i>Fig.</i> XIV. which represents
a smaller Foot, divided into ten
Parts. <i>Fig.</i> XIII. exhibits a wooden Instrument,
exactly of the same Size with
the Figure. In all the Figures I have represented
the Length and Breadth by Diameters
and Diagonals; but the Height
or Depth, by pricked Perpendiculars. I
hope the Mathematical Reader will find
no Fault with the quadrangular Passage
B in <i>Fig.</i> <span class="smcap">I.</span> for conveying the Air, in
order to ventilate the Coals; nor with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>

<p><em>An Explanation of the Figures, representing
some</em> Chinese <em>Utensils.</em></p>

<p><i>Fig.</i> I. Represents a Kind of Kettle, curiously
made of <em>Chinese</em> Copper, furnished
with a Handle, divided by a Copper Partition;
and which, though at first View, it
appears to be one Vessel, is yet, upon narrower
Inspection, found to be two, with
two Coverings; for A represents a small Furnace,
into which the Coals are put; and B,
the Mouth of the Furnace, covered with
Cross-Bars, for the better Ventilation of the
Coals. The other Vessel has its internal
Surface lined, or covered with Tin, serves
either for drying, or boiling the <em>Tea</em>, and
is furnished with a particular small Tube,
the Cover of which is exhibited by <em>a</em>; by
the Benefit of which, the large Coverings,
C D, being shut up, the Vapours of the
<em>Tea</em> may be retained, or allowed to exhale
at Pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Fig.</i> II. E represents a Copper Vessel,
in which the <em>Tea</em> is either boiled, or preserved,
when dry. E represents its Tube,
and F the covering of the Tube.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fig.</i> III. and IV. G G exhibit different
Views of one and the same Vessel, the internal
Surface of which is lined with a thin
gilded Plate, of some proper Metal, and
the external Surface, covered with Lack,
after the Manner of the <em>Chinese</em>.</p>

<p><i>Fig.</i> V. I I. No. 1. represents a genuine
<em>Chinese Tea-Leaf</em> macerated, and stretched
to its full Extent. No. 2. A Leaf of the
<em>Chamelæagnus</em>, or what the <em>French</em> call <em>Piment
Royal</em>, artificially dried.</p>

<p><i>Fig.</i> VI. K represents another, and, in my
Opinion, a spurious <em>Chinese Tea-Leaf</em>, brought
from <em>China</em>.</p>

<p><i>Fig.</i> VII. L exhibits a Leaf of what
<cite>Clusius</cite> calls the <em>Spiræa Theophrasti</em>, found
in the Green-Houses of <em>Copenhagen</em>, and so
like the spurious <em>Chinese Tea</em>, with which
the genuine is adulterated, that the one cannot
be distinguished from the other.</p>

<p><i>Fig.</i> VIII. M represents a curious Polygonal
<em>Tea-Pot</em>, probably made of sealed
<em>Lemnian</em>, or <em>Silesian</em> Earth. N its Lid
joined by the golden Chain O, to its Handle
P. and Q. Its Stroup curiously tipped
with Gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fig.</i> IX. R represents another earthen
<em>Tea-Pot</em>, with a Stroup, but of a roundish,
or oblong Form, and in the Lid of which,
is fixed a Ring of Clay S for taking it off
and putting it on: Both these earthen <em>Tea-Pots</em>
are highly fragrant; the former is of a
light, and the latter of a pale red Colour.</p>

<p><i>Fig.</i> X. T exhibits a Copper Vessel
lined with Tin, capable of containing four
Ounces; and whose inferior Part about the
Letter V is covered with a Kind of Case,
woven of such Wood as the <em>Europeans</em> use
in making Sieves; but so as that the Vessel
can be taken out of the Case. But I
am of Opinion, that the <em>Chinese</em> pour their
hot <em>Tea</em>, whether infused, or boiled, into
this, in order to prevent the scalding of their
Hands; and so cool the Liquor, as that it
may neither burn their Lips, nor Tongue.</p>

<p><i>Fig.</i> XI. X represents this wooden Case,
or Handle, by itself.</p>

<p><i>Fig.</i> XII. Y exhibits a small wooden
Ladle, with a semicircular wooden Handle.</p>

<p><i>Fig.</i> XIII. Z represents a small, and
somewhat incurvated wooden Spatula.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fig.</i> XIV. represents a small geometrical
Foot, divided into ten equal Parts, for ascertaining
the just Proportion of the Utensils
described.</p>

<p>It is to be observed, that these Vessels
are of a grateful fragrant Smell, resembling
those of the <em>Juniper</em>, <em>Cypress</em>, or <em>Aloes Tree</em>,
which is certainly owing to the bituminous
Earth of which they are formed.
Thus we have before observed, that the
<em>Kalenburgian</em> bituminous Earth is as fragrant
as Violets; and that, according to <cite>Martinius</cite>,
it is on account of the Fragrance of
these Vessels, that the <em>Chinese</em> are so fond
of them, and purchase them at such immense
Prices. We have also taken Notice
from <cite>Tulpius</cite>, and <cite>Maffæus</cite>, that these
Pots, Vessels, and other Pieces of <em>Tea</em> Equipage,
are, by the <em>Chinese</em>, bought at the
Rate of some Thousand <em>Nobles</em>, wrapped up
in silken Coverings, shewn only to their
nearest Friends, and as much valued by
them as Adamants, Gems, and curious Medals
are by the <em>Europeans</em>. Let the <em>Europeans</em>,
therefore, before they drink <em>Tea</em>,
which itself is void of Smell, provide themselves
with the fragrant Vessels of <em>Gnihing</em>,
and the Waters of the Rivulet <em>Vussie</em>, which
they must bring uncorrupted from <em>China</em>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and then, on Supposition the Air was the
same, which it is not, the same Effects
might be produced in <em>Europe</em> by <em>Tea</em>, as
those which it is boasted to produce in <em>China</em>.
It is therefore far more congruous to Truth
and Reason, to suppose, that the <em>Chinese</em> are
free from the Stone, Gout, and arthritic Pains,
rather by the Goodness of their Water, than
by their <em>Tea</em> alone, which may also contribute
something to their Happiness in these
Respects. Besides, the Force and Virtue of
<em>Tea</em>, must be considerably impaired and lost,
by the intense Heat of the Sun, during so
long a Voyage, in which the <em>Equator</em> must
be twice crossed, before the Ships arrive at
any <em>European</em> Ports. Hence we know from
Experience, that those Persons most consult
the Interest of the <em>Europeans</em>, who, according
to <em>Mercator</em>, in his Description of <em>China</em>,
advise, that <em>Rhubarb</em>, with the best Sort of
which, <em>China</em> abounds, should be brought
through <em>Persia</em> by Land, lest it should be
spoiled and corrupted by so long a Voyage.
What must therefore happen to <em>Tea</em>,
or the <em>Chinese Chamelæagnus</em>, which is in
<em>China</em> frequently toasted in an Iron Pan,
so as to corrugate and conglomerate its
Leaves, according to <cite>Rhodius</cite> and <cite>Martinius</cite>?
For, if the Virtues of <em>Rhubarb</em>, which
is a compact Substance, are, by such a Voy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>age,
exhaled, this Misfortune must much
more happen to the tender Leaves of <em>Tea</em>,
which are gathered in the <em>Spring</em>, and have
a bitterish Taste, but no Smell. Hence we
may infer, that these Leaves are, after their
Arrival at <em>Europe</em>, possessed of a volatile and
fixed Salt, but deprived of their Sulphur, especially
the most volatile Part of it; for, if
they were intirely destitute of Sulphur, they
would not take Flame, nor could they be
burned. The Author of a Book, intitled,
<cite>Artificia Hominum Miranda Naturæ in</cite> Sina
&amp; Europa, in <cite>Chap. 35.</cite> tells us, "that in
<em>Chekiang</em>, in <em>China</em>, there are Woods of
<em>Mulberry-Trees</em>, so many Silk-Worms, and
such immense Quantities of Silk, that a
Person may there purchase ten silken Suits
of Cloaths at an easier Rate, than he can
have one of Cloth in any Part of <em>Europe</em>.
The <em>Chinese</em> prune their <em>Mulberry-Trees</em>
every Year, as the <em>Europeans</em> do their
Vines; nor do they suffer them to grow
up into tall Trees, because they have found
from long Experience, that the Leaves of
the smallest Trees produce the finest Substance
for Silk, and the best Thread: For
which Reason, they justly distinguish between
the first and second Weaving of
the Thread: The former is produced
when the Worms are nourished by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Leaves which appear in the <em>Spring</em>, and
are soft and delicate: The latter is, when
they are fed upon the <em>Summer</em> Leaves,
which are coarse and hard; so great is
the Difference of Work produced by these
Animals only by a Change of Food."
If this Account of the Nourishment of Silk-Worms
is true, as we <em>Europeans</em> find it by
Experience, so it is equally certain, that there
is as great a Difference between those Leaves
of the <em>Chinese Tea</em>, or <em>European Chamelæagnus</em>,
which appear in the <em>Spring</em>, and those
which are produced in the <em>Summer</em>, as I
have all along insinuated in this Work. By
this remarkable Passage of the anonymous
Author, I am more and more convinced,
that the vernal Leaves of the <em>Chamelæagnus</em>,
or <em>European Tea</em>, are possessed of different
Virtues from those which appear in the <em>Summer</em>,
when the Sun has entered <em>Leo</em>: And
those who will not grant this Truth, are
confuted by the palpable Instance drawn
from the Nourishment of the Silk-Worms.</p>

<p>By way of Digression, I shall intreat every
Lover of Truth, to throw the Leaves, (not
the Shrub, Flowers, or Seeds) of the <em>European
Chamelæagnus</em>, which, when dry, have
no Scent upon live Coals, and do the same
with an equal Quantity of <em>Chinese Tea</em>, tho'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
in different Rooms, and by the exact Resemblance
of the Smell diffused by each, he
will be convinced that the <em>Chamelæagnus</em> is
a Plant of the same Species with <em>Tea</em>.</p>

<p>I am not acquainted with all the Acts,
Statutes, and Laws, of the different Cities of
<em>Europe</em>, made for suppressing and preventing
the Avarice and Exorbitance of Apothecaries;
only in Upper and Lower <em>Germany</em>,
a certain Fine is, by public Authority,
laid upon the Apothecary who sells
old and mouldy Herbs, or uses any Methods
to make them appear good and fresh: Nay,
it is customary, in some Provinces of <em>Germany</em>,
publickly to burn such Herbs, Roots,
Shrubs, or Plants as are bad, or suspected
to be more than one Year old; lest the
poorer Inhabitants should, like the Widow
mentioned in <cite>Luke</cite>, Chap. viii. 43, spend
all their Money upon Physicians, without
being healed by any: But the Case is quite
otherwise with <em>Tea</em>; for supposing it to be
only one Year old, when it is put into the
Ships at <em>China</em>, it must be double that
Time, and often more, before it arrives to
us. How great then is the Stupidity of
us <em>Europeans</em>, who are never disgusted at
the Avarice and Baseness of the <em>Asiatics</em>,
though they should send us <em>Tea</em> as old as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the <em>Trojan</em> War, whilst they use it fresh and
good themselves? Besides, as the <em>Tea</em>-Leaves
have no Smell, it is highly probable, that
the <em>Asiatics</em> have infused and macerated them,
and then dried them a second Time for
the Use of the <em>Europeans</em>; since, when
chewed in the Mouth, they are resolved
into a Kind of gross Powder. I am also
of the Opinion of the celebrated <cite>Wormius</cite>,
who thought it highly probable, that <em>Tea</em>-Leaves
were either mixed with others, or
had others intirely substituted in their stead.
If we are at such Care and Pains to discharge
and prohibit the Sale of old <em>European</em>
Plants, ought we not, with the same
Rigour and Authority, to prohibit the Import
of <em>Tea</em> deprived of its Smell, and long
ago dried and prepared for the Use of the
<em>Chinese</em>? The Man would surely be ridiculous
who should import into <em>Europe</em> large
Quantities of <em>Tobacco</em>, already cut small for
the present Smoaking of the <em>Indians</em>, or
<em>Americans</em>; or who should commend it
on account of its unctuous Sulphur, or prefer
it to large Pricks, made up hard and compact
for the Sake of keeping; for cut <em>Tobacco</em>
after it has been kept some Months and become
dry, loses all its Virtue, and is despised
by a phlegmatic <em>European</em>. It is
also obvious from what has been said, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
after the <em>Chinese</em> have toasted their <em>Tea</em>, they
preserve it in close stopped Vessels, that it
may not be corrupted, or too much dried
by the Access of the Air: It is, therefore,
the Duty of every <em>European</em> to join in engaging
the Legislature to put a Stop to this
epidemical Evil, and prohibit the Abuse, not
only of <em>Tea</em>, but also of <em>Tobacco</em>, since both
of these, and <em>Coffee</em>, as I have before shewn,
so enervate the <em>European</em> Men, that they
become incapable of propagating their Species,
like <em>Eunuchs</em>, some of whom are highly
salacious; but it is sufficiently known, that
they are incapable of Procreation, tho' they
emit something analogous to <em>Semen</em>. For
this Reason, the <em>Turks</em> perform Castration in
a different Manner from the <em>Italians</em>, since
the former cut off <em>Penis</em>, <em>Testicles</em>, and all;
and the latter only the <em>Testicles</em>. The Curious
may consult <cite>Bartholinus Anatom. Reformat.
Lib. 1.</cite> at the End of which, they
will be informed why, and when it happens,
that Horses and Bulls procreate their respective
Species after Castration: The <em>Turks</em>, therefore,
lest their Eunuchs should provide
them with a spurious Progeny, treat them
in a far more inhuman Manner, than the
<em>Italians</em> do. Since we have mentioned the
<em>Turks</em>, it will not be improper to observe,
that the <em>Persians</em>, though salacious, are, ne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>vertheless,
generally impotent: For since,
on account of <em>Polygamy</em>, which they have
in common with the <em>Turks</em>, they have a
numerous Progeny to be supported; when
they copulate with their Wives and Whores,
they are not so sollicitous to procure an
Offspring, as, like the infamous <em>Onan</em>, to
emit a vapid and unprolific Seed, which, on
account of the <em>Coffee</em> corrupted in their
Veins, may, by a Person acquainted with
Chymical Principles, be justly compared to
the Lees of Wine, in a great Measure deprived
of the volatile Salt and Sulphur of
the Wine: Or it may be compared to
that of the Eunuchs of other less brutal
Nations; or that of the <em>Scythians</em>, who are
by <cite>Hippocrates</cite>, in <cite>Lib. de Aere, Aquis,
&amp; Locis</cite>, stiled <cite>emasculated and effeminate
Mortals</cite>. The same Author, in the Work
now quoted, assigns other Causes for the
Sterility of the <em>Scythians</em>; "for, <em>says he</em>, they
make so deep Incisions in the Veins behind
their Ears, that when they come
to be married, they are impotent." But
<cite>Olearius</cite> informs us, that without this Practice,
the salacious <em>Persians</em> emasculate themselves
only by the Use of <em>Coffee</em>: Nor is this
surprizing, since Salacity, instead of promoting
Procreation, procures Sterility. Hence
a common Strumpet rarely becomes preg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>nant,
notwithstanding her frequent venereal
Encounters with salacious Rakes and Debauchees.
Besides, there is a vast Difference
between stimulating, cold, and languid Constitutions
to Venery, which is obtained by
<em>Rocket</em>, and fecundating the <em>Semen</em>, which
is obtained by some Vegetables, as Sweet Almonds,
Pine Kernels, Pistachio Nuts, and
Chesnuts; as also by Animals, as Capons,
Larks, Thrushes, Kids-Flesh, Mutton, or
Veal. I do not deny, but <em>Coffee</em>, <em>Chocolate</em>,
and <em>Tobacco</em>, have a Power of stimulating
to Venery, but may yet induce Sterility,
because they consist of heterogeneous
Parts, or rather act by their whole Substances:
But all these Things are unfit for
fecundating the <em>Semen</em>; as also all other Substances
of a drying Quality, and not cold
Substances, as is commonly believed. The
Effeminacy and Impotence then produced
by drinking <em>Coffee</em>, and smoaking <em>Tobacco</em>,
are sufficiently obvious. And to these two,
if I am not mistaken, good Judges will join
<em>Tea</em>, because according to <cite>Martinius</cite>, the <em>Chinese</em>
by the last not only extinguish Thirst, but
also dissipate their Humours to such a Degree,
that they hardly ever spit. It is also
by a drying Quality, that the <em>Agnus Castus</em>,
<em>Rue</em>, <em>Mint</em>, and <em>Camphire</em>, render Men impotent.
Besides, <em>Tea</em> is to the <em>Chinese</em> them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>selves
only a new Thing, whose Virtues and
Faculties they have not, as yet, sufficiently
investigated; for which Reason I justly prefer
to it our own <em>Betony</em>, which has been
deservedly celebrated for so many Ages.
The <em>Chinese</em> Incapacity of Spitting is, therefore,
a manifest Proof that <em>Tea</em> contains
a drying, though not an intensely hot Sulphur.
I do not find it expresly affirmed
by Authors, that <em>Chocolate</em>, as well as <em>Coffee</em>,
produces Sterility and Impotence; since
they rather assert, that it proves a Stimulus
to Venery: A Circumstance confirmed
by the Accounts of some Men of Learning
and Penetration, upon their Return
from <em>Africa</em> and <em>America</em>. But as <cite>Benzon</cite>
informs us, "that <em>Chocolate</em> has a somewhat
bitterish Taste, and refrigerates, or dries the
Body, without producing the smallest Degree
of Intoxication:" Hence we may
reasonably infer, that as <em>Chocolate</em> agrees with
<em>Coffee</em> and <em>Tea</em>, in one Third of its Qualities,
so all these three exactly agree with each
other, in producing Effeminacy and Impotence:
But I shall not here attempt an Investigation
of their other Qualities. I therefore
hope, that for the future, the <em>Europeans</em>
will be wise, and reject <em>Coffee</em>, <em>Chocolate</em>,
and <em>Tea</em>; since they are all either
equally bad, or equally good: Nay, I hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to see People of all Ranks and Conditions,
have as great an Aversion to them as the
<em>Mahometans</em> and <em>Turks</em>, or rather their Emperors
have to <em>Tobacco</em>, the Lovers of which,
as well as thole who are idle, prodigal,
barren, impotent, or effeminate, they will
not suffer to live within their Territories.
There is another Method of producing
Barrenness and Impotence, probably brought
from <em>Asia</em> into <em>Europe</em>, which is the indiscriminate
Use of Venesection, in both Sexes,
behind the Ears, for intolerable Tooth-achs.
But let me tell the Persons, who, despising
the Authority of <cite>Hippocrates</cite>, suffer, like
the <em>Scythians</em>, the Veins behind their Ears
to be opened, that they will afterwards
repent their Folly, when they find Sterility
and Impotence to be their Fate. Some
practical Physicians may furnish us with
Instances of Tooth-achs, accompanied with
Deliriums, and other violent Symptoms;
but none of them seem to have observed,
that a Tooth-ach, when removed by opening
the Veins behind the Ears, has proved
the Cause of Sterility, as <cite>Hippocrates</cite>, who,
according to <cite>Macrobius</cite>, was never deceived
himself, nor imposed upon others, affirms,
not of a single Instance or two, but of the
whole Nation of the <em>Scythians</em>. Let, therefore,
the Masters and Mistresses of Fami<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>lies
reject the Custom of cauterising or opening
the Veins behind the Ears, unless they
incline that their Children should be cursed
with Sterility, or Impotence, which are
attended with a dire and numerous Train
of Woes. So that we hope the <em>Europeans</em>
will guard against Sterility; produced in
the <em>Indies</em> by <em>Coffee</em>, <em>Tea</em>, and <em>Chocolate</em>;
and in <em>Scythia</em> by opening, or burning the
Veins behind the Ears.</p>

<p>Having already considered the Regimen
of the <em>Chinese</em>, I shall proceed to take Notice
of their Manners, Customs, and Dispositions:
In the Execution of which Design
I shall take my Accounts from <cite>Martinius</cite>,
who, when treating of Quack-Physicians,
affirms, that the <em>Chinese</em>, as well as the <em>Cretans</em>,
are greatly addicted to Lying. The
same Author, in his <cite>Atlas Chinicus</cite>, speaks
in the following Manner: "The <em>Europeans</em>
are superior to the <em>Chinese</em> in Fortitude,
but the <em>Chinese</em> excel the <em>Europeans</em>
in Brightness of Genius: They are also
sagacious, cunning, intrepid, industrious,
and dextrous, in managing sudden Emergencies:
Notwithstanding their great Abundance,
they collect and preserve the
most worthless Things, such as Dogs
Bones, Feathers, and Hogs Bristles, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
they sell. Their Penetration often discovers
itself by Fraud, Guile, and Imposition.
Their Merchants are industrious
and active, and the whole of the
Inhabitants spare no Pains, and think no
Labour too severe, when they have the
smallest Prospect of Gain, because they
always prefer Profit to Honesty. They
have sound and robust Constitutions, being
accustomed to Fatigue from their
Infancy: Some of them are of as fair
Complexions as the <em>Europeans</em>."</p>

<p>As I have before compared the <em>Chinese</em>
with the <em>European</em> Regimen, so I should
here institute the Comparison between their
Manners and Dispositions, if <cite>Barclay</cite> had
not already executed that Design with great
Judgment and Accuracy: Only I must observe,
that their Cunning surpasses our Prudence,
and that their Fraud sufficiently
evinces their Inclination to deceive us. In
a word, Cunning, Avarice, and Lying, are
the distinguishing Characteristicks of the
<em>Asiatics</em>, who yearly defraud the <em>Europeans</em>
of such immense Sums of Money for <em>Teas</em>.
As <cite>Hippocrates</cite> spared no Pains to remove and
root out the <em>Athenian</em> Plague, so I have used
the utmost of my Endeavours to destroy the
raging epidemical Madness of importing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
<em>Tea</em> into <em>Europe</em> from <em>China</em>; since I have
demonstrated, that the <em>Chinese Tea</em>, and the
<em>Chamelæagnus</em>, or <em>Myrtus Brabantica</em>, are
Plants of the same Species. Let such, therefore,
as are unacquainted with <em>Botany</em>, cease
to use <em>Chinese Tea</em>, and in its Room substitute
our <em>European Chamelæagnus</em>. Tho'
I have not Authority sufficient to force my
Opinions upon others, yet let me perswade
my Countrymen to use <em>Betony</em>, which, as
<cite>Antonius Musa</cite> informs us, cures no less than
forty Disorders, instead of the <em>Chinese Tea</em>,
which is without Smell, corrupted by the
Length of the Voyage, and destitute of the
Qualities it is possessed of in <em>Asia</em>: Nor do
I in the least doubt, but the <em>European Betony</em>
would happily cure those Disorders, for
which the <em>Chinese</em> recommend their <em>Tea</em>.
The Physicians of <em>China</em> are indeed to be
commended for curing Diseases by Abstinence
from Meat and Drink, and the Use
of simple Decoctions, or other similar Things;
because Nature delights in Simplicity, is
contented with little, and overpowered by
a Farrago of compound Medicines.</p>

<p>If I should be laughed at for my Opinions,
I shall comfort myself with this Reflection,
that I have always had so sacred
and inviolable an Attachment to Truth,
that I have chearfully gone whithersoever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
she led me; so that I may, with a few
Variations, put a Close to this Work, in
the Words of <cite>Cicero</cite>, in <cite>Academ. Quest.
Lib. 4.</cite></p>

<p>"If I had been induced to this Work
by Ostentation, or the Love of Dispute,
I ought to be condemned, not only as
a Fool, but also as a vicious and immoral
Man; for, if Obstinacy in Trifles
is justly ridiculed, it ought to be much
more so in Affairs of Importance. During
the whole Course of my Life I have
been impartial in my Searches after Truth,
and never attempted to impose upon the
Judgment of others; for I can swear by
the immortal God, that I not only have
an ardent Love to Truth, but also that
I speak the genuine Sentiments of my
Mind; for why should not I desire to
discover Truth, when I rejoice to find
what bears a near Resemblance to it.
As it is the peculiar Glory of the human
Nature, to perceive Truth in its
genuine Colours; so, it is a Disgrace to
Reason to embrace Falshood for Truth.
I do not, however, lay claim to Infallibility,
since I confess that I may err, as well
as other Men."</p>

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
